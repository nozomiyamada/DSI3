  "title":"Effective Body Language Mirroring",
  "text":"Mirroring is the first hypnotic skill everyone should know.\n\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly easy, teaches important habits, and it is sufficient to induce sleeping trance. If you aren\u2019t getting amazing results, you aren\u2019t doing it right.\n\n\nBefore I knew what mirroring was, I remember being at home on a video call with my parents and noticing they had the same laugh. They would start laughing at the same time, their eyes would crinkle in the same way, and when they finished laughing they would both relax and breathe out in the exact same way.\n\n\nAfter we logged off for the night, I started to wonder if this was part of the reason old couples look so similar. Not only do they eat the same food and share the same environment for decades, but they also start to share the same expressions and mannerisms.\n\n\nI pulled up Google Chrome to do some research and I learned a few things:\n\n\nPeople match body language unconsciously all the time- to signal friendship, comfort, and alignment. If you\u2019re excited, I\u2019m excited. If you\u2019re incredibly happy, then I\u2019m incredibly happy with you and for you. Or if you\u2019re hated, if you\u2019re not accepted, then I\u2019m just as much of an outcast as you are.\n\n\nIt\u2019s a deep and tribal feeling that might be called \nconnection\n or \nrapport\n. It\u2019s a real feeling that people really enjoy.\n\n\nI also learned that the principle of treating your acquaintances like your friends applies here as well. If you mirror with people that you\u2019ve just met, you\u2019ll begin to feel connected in ways that you never have before.\n\n\nAfter I learned all this, I started to try mirroring in the real world, and I learned things that weren\u2019t online so I could bring them back to you.\n\n\n---\n\n\nThe goal when mirroring is to come into perfect sync. You move when they move, with the same duration and speed and in a way that\u2019s complementary to their movement.\n\n\nIf they pull something to themselves, you pull something to yourself, with the same speed, start and end.\n\n\nMimicking static body language like someone\u2019s posture is effective, but coming into full dynamic sync is incredibly powerful and represents the pinnacle of mirroring. You can attain this by learning the signs of when someone is about to move, and practicing regularly.\n\n\nUse your peripheral vision. Most of the large body language movements will be visible without you staring directly at them, so just notice them in your periphery and adjust accordingly.\n\n\nWhen you arrive somewhere, arrive in the body language of the person you\u2019re mirroring. If they\u2019re sitting in a relaxed manner, don\u2019t sit and then mirror, make it all one movement and sit directly as they are. This works especially well for making a first impression.\n\n\nOn natural movement in general, you\u2019ll have to use your best judgment. If someone is using energetic hand gestures as they speak, don\u2019t repeat those as they\u2019re talking, but if you\u2019re talking about something with a similar energy later, then do the same sorts of gestures. Beyond best judgment, you\u2019ll need a dancer\u2019s sense of movement. Move smoothly, don\u2019t compensate for mistakes, and just relax.\n\n\nAbove all else, have the other person\u2019s best interest at heart. You\u2019ll naturally feel more connected with them by the mirroring, so allow yourself to feel that strongly and enjoy interacting with another human being with a whole vibrant inner world just like your own.\n\n\n---\n\n\nAfter I really started to develop my understanding of mirroring I had a new power to affect people around me. People listen to people they like, and they took my words more seriously. If you want the power of influence and you\u2019ll use it for the good of the people around you, consider following me on \nSubstack\n or \nTwitter\n and I can teach you more.\n\n\nOr if you\u2019re not sure about the effectiveness of mirroring, go out and try it. Don\u2019t try it once, try it until it works, and when it does, come back and find more things to try.",

  "title":"Re-Mixing Memories with a Combination of NLP &amp; Hypnosis",
  "text":"Emotionally Re-Mixing Memories while in a State of Trance\n\n\nContrary to popular belief, personality by 1st grade is not destiny. Imprinted emotional reactions and character alterations are possible throughout life. For example, Aristotle taught his students that obtaining virtuous traits such as bravery is had via the repetition of brave acts. Re-Mixing Traumatic Memories exercises focus on harnessing intense hurtful memories and re-fashioning them into lasting energized structural personality changes. Someone can transform early traumatic memories into a personality that bonds, loves, and protects like a pit bull or desired personality traits.  \nIntrigued?\n  The following motivational and emotional modification tool may be what you seek.  \n\n\nWhy mixing works\n:\n After memory recall, the human mind alters and re-saves the images. The key to emotional re-mixing is introducing new information during memory recall. Reflective pondering or discussion long after the brain hi-jack may provide intellectual insights. However, a future-triggered memory will replay with the exact modalities and intensities as initially experienced because the new wisdom is stored elsewhere. The memory has a start button like a short video clip, and insightful intellectual knowledge is indexed. Techniques of visually putting troubling memories behind yourself work because the mind tones down the associated emotional response. Dissociation techniques are beneficial, and a head-on tool for harnessing the intensity of disturbing recalled memories by imprinting new information can drastically alter emotional responses and core beliefs to obtain empowering positive outcomes.  \n\n\nRe-Framing and Emotionally Re-Mixing Images like a DJ Exercise\n\n\nStep One.\n While calm and in a creative state of mind, brainstorm and think of various empowering counterwords for current triggers or past troubling traumas. Counterword \nexamples\n: \"Bravery,\" \"Alpha,\" \"Loved,\" \"Stronger\n,\" \"\nRelentless\n,\" \"\nConfident\n,\" \netc\n.  \nProblematic Example\n: Fear of Public Speaking.  \nCounter word:\n \n\"Confident.\"\n \n\n\nStep Two.\n Envision your empowering counterword by itself in 3D block letters. I prefer white letters with thin black lines, but any color will do. A block letter with imagined sides seems more soulful than standard print letters, but both typesets imprint on the subconscious mind. \n\n\nStep Three.\n  Relax into a calm trance state. Trance induction typically only occurs in perceived safe places, so find a conducive setting that works for you. Deep trance states translate into stronger counterword subconscious imprinting at areas such as a sauna, hot bath, hot tub, forest, or quiet beach setting. Vacations provide new locations for more profound and more powerful imprinting.  \ni.e., sunrise on a beach.\n \n\n\nStep Four.\n  Carefully remember the problematic example or traumatic memory and quickly visualize the empowering 3-D letters in the top center part of the image during memory recall. Also, imagine the 3-D counter words as if they are in front of a picture. Finally, visualize walking into a room and noticing the counterwords before the rest of the trauma images. Placing the letters at the beginning of the small video-type clip speaks powerfully to the subconscious and alters the emotion associated with the traumatic recall.  \nNotation\n: For some, visualizing and hearing the counter word imprints more effectively on one\u2019s in-breath or out-breath.\n \n\n\nStep Five.\n  Auditorily add the counterword. I.e., \"Loved\" while visualizing the 3-D letters. \n\n\nStep Six.\n  Focus on incorporating the associated counterword kinesthetic sensation. I.e., trigger a remembered and imprint a past feeling of a loving moment meant to help your subconscious respond differently to past cues and triggers.  \n\n\nStep Seven.\n \nRecall the newly\n \nRe-Mixed Memory\n.\n  Hopefully, this helps, Your Friendly Neighborhood Emotionally Re-mixing DJ.  \ud83d\ude0a\n\n\nPossible Trauma hurdles\n:\n Anxiety hijacks prevent most trance induction techniques. Anxiety is quite normal and understandable, given traumatic memories. Finally, getting fed up with a hard-wired life-limiting anxiety derailment pattern is an excellent, motivating reason for practicing this re-mixing exercise. My suggestion is to relax as much as possible and proceed if possible. The worst-case scenario is to try again tomorrow. Believe it or not, your subconscious does want to help and support your consciously defined goals. First, however, it must be housebroken like a new fluffy, playful puppy. Maybe try going into a trance with the help of hot water, classical music, a local quiet nature setting, etc. Dealing with certain types of memories is stressful and can trigger avoidance and self-protective instincts. Sometimes, your mind will not allow you to recall all of the details of the traumatic memory, but the full details of the memory still power other parts of the mind. Calmly sitting and waiting for the memory to fully come in may allow for a more potent and effective re-mix process. If the fill-in-the-blank trauma experience is eventually re-mixed, I promise your that life will become much different! The subconscious mind can be hypnotically trained via deep trance to stop participating in oppression and opt out of identified forms of abuse. Once an abusive person senses the opposite of emotional cracks for manipulation, they will most likely move on to others. Keep trying!!!!!!!!!!!! It never hurts to be able to establish boundaries, etc. Before long, you will feel like Gondor in Lord of the Rings when he says, \u201cYou shall not pass!\u201d as he symbolically slams down his staff, combining visual, auditory, and kinesthetic modalities.\n\n\nBottom line:\n \nIt\u2019s your life, your brain generating sensations, and contrary to popular opinion, your choice, so why not grab the steering wheel of life and drive forward?\n \n\n\nExpected Outcomes Timeline for the daily practice of meditation with 3-D\n \n\n\nletter inductions\n:\n After four to six weeks of daily practice, 3-D \n\n\ncounter words routinely appear in moments of need and stress. \n\n\nReversal of targeted habits of avoidance, withdrawal, or submission to \n\n\nundesired outcomes. \n\n\nSix months\n of daily meditation practice, subconsciously randomly generated suggestions of supportive, but different new empowering words. \n\n\nOne year plus\n of practice, motivational, and guiding subconscious solutions with symbolic and spiritual energy patterns.\n\n\nExample Box Breath Meditation\n\n\nIn-breath \"I choose Stronger,\" out-breath, In-breath \"I choose Happier,\" \n\n\nout-breath \"Drive Forward.\" Repeat the mantra at least 25 times. Practice at a \n\n\nquiet place daily for six weeks. Eventually, your subconscious assists  \n\n\nduring stress. This mantra contains overlapping NLP and \n\n\nhypnotic theories for creating motivating images.",

  "text":"I am curious about the eye accessing cues and the ability to visualize. I seem to be having a very hard time visualizing new and creative ideas.\n\n\nRecently I tried to design the backyard garden and could not visualize it.

The feedback was acquired by sending a custom binary closed question 48h after the conversation ended probing both sides buyer and seller.\n\n\nMy approach\nI was looking to preprocess the whole dialogue (remove stopwords, lemmatisation) as one text and pass it through a TF-IDF (use n-grams as well). Then based on the frequency of words determine how relevant those words are to a transaction or not and then fit a classifier (naive bayes) to determine the probability of a transaction. An open question still to answer is to use the whole dialogue up until a point or just use the last 2,4\u2026 message exchanged between the buyer and the seller.\n\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts on the topic.

(\nFYI - I am excluding instinctual low effort energy mental energy conservation trance states of minds where working individuals attempt to go into automatic mode as a form of work avoidance.  LOL)\n  In my opinion, our minds work more in an analogue fashion which is cumulative (\nadding, subtracting or altering)\n instead of a digital mode which is why both meditation and hypnosis keep resulting in slight brain changes with each passing session.  If our minds operated like digital computers, getting rid of bad habits would be a \nOnce & Done programming Update.\n  Meditation has become a wide ranging spiritual practice that entices individuals to enter a natural trance state of mind. Going into a hypnotic state is more intentional and is very similar to a trance state which happens naturally when someone zones out watching TV or drives on a scenic low volume highway for hours at a time. One big reason that advertisers pay so much for TV or media ads is that one's mind is more receptive to paid for marketing messages when a person's mind is already in a trance state.   In my personal opinion, a lot of the benefits derived from NLP are associated to NLP exercises sinking into the subconscious when one's mind is in a degree of trance which allows for an enhanced number of additional new neurological connections.  \nThe above theory is my personal observations derived from over 30 years of various forms of meditative practice, spiritual research and my NLP hobby.\n \nI do not have an NLP certification from any company.",

On the other hand, books are written now on prompt engineering. I wonder if it might be one of the fields\/departments in universities in the future. Or may it have a chance to appear on the one of popular job titles on LinkedIn etc. What's your opinion? I would be glad if you know any resourse which is nailing this topic.",

Prof. Fuchs is head of the  section \"Phenomenological Psychopathology and Psychotherapy\" at the  Department of General Psychiatry at Heidelberg University Hospital, head  of research at the Karl Jaspers Comprehensive Edition of the Heidelberg  Academy of Sciences and Chairman of the German Society for  Phenomenological Anthropology, Psychiatry and Psychotherapy (DGAP).\n\n\nA  particular research focus is the study of the relationship between  phenomenology and cognitive neuroscience, especially with regard to  theories of embodiment and enactivism. In connection with this topic,  Prof. Fuchs is frequently invited to congresses and seminars in  psychopathology and psychotherapy to give lectures and advanced training  on his proposed paradigm shift as a critique of the currently  prevailing \"neuroconstructivism\" towards an \"embodiment of  consciousness\".\n\n\nSince I have also  been concerned with these aspects for some time and had used Prof.  Fuchs' literature, such as his newly published book \"Defense of Man -  Basic Questions of an Embodied Anthropology\" (2020) in my essays, I was  particularly pleased that he agreed to answer my colleague Axel St\u00f6cker  of the \"Blog of Big Questions\" and me our questions in this interview.\n\n\nMore at:\n \nhttps:\/\/philosophies.de\/index.php\/2022\/11\/20\/das-verkoerperte-bewusstsein\/\n\n\nor:\n \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1ouxs6P3Enc&t=3440s",

Whether it be the longer you take the more satisfaction one receives or perhaps the amount of time is too long and the person starts to care less and that satisfaction would start to wane the longer it takes to close the loop.  \n\n\nOr maybe this is just too context dependent to give a straight answer?  \n\n\nI would appreciate any feedback.

I realize that's a bit vague and they weren't able to really quantify that much.  \n\n\nWhile I've learned quite a bit of NLP and trained with several hypnotists and NLP trainers, I have never actually trained with Bandler. A lot of my trainers have trained with Bandler, but not necessarily exclusively or intensively so far as I know. What I am wondering is if there's anything he does that's unique or that seems to be particularly effective. In practice, how would that old-school Bandler compare to his new stuff or John Grinder's New Code, or any other prominent NLPers?\n\n\nI know he focuses on unconscious installation rather than more overt\/conscious installation of techniques. Can anybody speak to that?\n\n\nThe other thing I am hearing is his older stuff seems to be better and that some of what he used to teach that was allegedly more effective may not be taught anymore. Obviously most people would want \"the good stuff\" or the secret techniques. I like to not buy into hype, but is there any validity to that? If so, is there anywhere to find\/learn the old stuff (books, videos, trainers carrying on the tradition, etc.)?",

  "text":"Hello, guys.\n\n\nI'm new to all of NLP's techniques and I still trying to put them into practice. One of them, Swish Pattern, gave me some doubts. \n\n\nWhen I read about it in a book, it basically stated that the image of the habit, experience, etc that you want to get rid of must be visualized in an associate state. On the contrary, the goal or experience you want to achieve must be visualized in a dissociated state.\n\n\nThe problem is that after reading more about associate and dissociated states from other books, I learned association relates to more positive results, making an event or experience more powerful. Instead, dissociation is related with make less powerful and painful an experience.\n\n\nSo what is the trick or the exemption with this technique?  It seems more logical to use dissociate sight for the image you want to get rid of and associate sight with the one you want.\n\n\nBtw, the from I learned this technique is Unlimited Power by Tony Robbins.\n\n\nThanks in advance.",

  "title":"NLP technique to stop cheating on his partner?",
  "text":"I'm coaching someone (my 1st time, I'm not charging him he asked me to practice on him to see if it helped when I said I started learning) who says he feels compelled to cheat no matter how hard he tries to give up for good he ends up returning to this behaviour. I've only used a few NLP techniques before (haven't learnt anything properly yet) but thought it would fit such addictive behaviour? I also use hypnosis but he says it hasn't helped him so far.\n\n\nI discussed it with him even though he was uncomfortable. He said his partner has low sex drive and it's also painful for her so he moved to pornography\/masturbation which didn't meet his needs, he said it increased his drive and then he started becoming tempted by women in the workplace etc until he started having an affair, that increased it even more until he started having multiple sex partners at once. He says he loves his partner and would never want her to be hurt by his actions so he wants to stop, he can't find an alternative solution which can cater for his high sex drive apart from leaving the relationship (she wouldn't agree to an open relationship) but he can't bring himself to leave her, saying it's purely a physical need, and once he's done the actual act he only feels remorse, it's not exciting or enjoyable for him.\n\n\nHe definitely has low self esteem and I think he's seeking validation. When I pointed this out he said he does get emotional validation from other family members, and that it's a biological problem.  He says his partner does meet his emotional needs  most of the time. When asked if his partner were to entertain an open relationship, he said regardless of the guilt he experienced (and what his partner thought) he believed it was totally wrong morally and just wanted to be given a technique to help him kickstart change as he's been trying to change from the first time it happened. He's had long periods in between where he's managed to stay away from all temptation.\n\n\nTL;DR:\n\n\nAn NLP master got a friend to feel nausea at the smell of fried chicken (she doubted NLP and he asked what do you wish to change, she said she's addicted to it). She was asked to recall a time she felt strong nausea. So he created an association so strong that she felt it when she smelt chicken, was this the Pavlov effect and how was he able to do it with immediate effect? I think it was an anchoring\/associating technique maybe, she said it lasted 3 months So I was curious to find out more about the technique? (This is the main point of my question).",

I went to a site on NLP, and looked at their page on weight loss. They had a few techniques as well as some common sense advice like eating only at certain times of day. They covered anchoring and,if I remember right, time line work.\n\n\nI have schizophrenia, and I take medicine that makes it way too easy to gain weight and hard to lose it. I thought about my previous strategy for losing weight, which worked to get me from around 290 to about 275. I thought about that strategy. Then, I went into the future on my timeline and saw myself at 200. I took the feelings from there and went back to a few still future steps, seeing how my previous strategy worked for me. I took from there feelings of self control, and changed my feeling of hunger in the middle of the night to being satisfied by water and celery. I then brought all that back to the present. On days when I have trouble, I don't eat nearly as much as I used to, and the celery and water are becoming more of a craving for me at night.\n\n\nThat's my feel good about myself part.

  "text":"TL;DR: New job, which I want to quit; moldy apartment, which I'm in the process of moving out of; everything feels a bit much, looking for a way to handle\n\n\nMore of a rant, indulge me.\n\n\nSo I finished my bachelors degree in electronics with 2,3. Yay :)\n\n\nHad a lovely one month vacation in July were I regularly worked out, enjoyed life and recovered from the brutal exam phase.\n\n\nNow I started my job at a new company (Industrial air conditioning as commissioning engineer)\n\n\nI feel at home in the job since it's basically what I've been doing in my apprenticeship and worklife for 4 years.\n\n\nBut:\n\n\n- The pay is with 46k just basic. No one in my class makes less.\n\n\n- As 100% field staff (which nobody wants to do, since living it a hotel everyweek is ... socially sacrificial) it feels very low. (I have confirmation from this from 5 other companies who offered me a position)\n\n\n- They have a ridiculous clause on traveling. Say you have to stay on site for 4 weeks. You get payed to drive to the workplace and if you leave ... but if you wanna spent a weekend at home, you only get gas money and no time. One guy even told me, he fell sick and drove home only for the boss to tell him he won't get payed for the 3,5h drive\n\n\n- Every coworker I asked about how the boss handles pay raises, clenched his jaw tightly and then gave me a polite neutral answer. (Except the honest guy. He laughed at me with an \"If you bother him enough he raises. But don't except the world\")\n\n\nSo I basically made my mind up about looking for a new job. Despite me liking the job itself and coworkers.\n\n\n____\n\n\nIn my private life:\n\n\nMy neighbor upstairs had water damage, so my bathroom and kitchen is a mold fest. I've got three different types of mold, which is a certain kind of achievement I guess.\n\n\nLuckily my buddy offered me his flat for cheap, since he left the country for a job opportunity.\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nSo mold, finding a new job, moving into a new flat, being only at home on the weekends, helping the girlfriend with her new flat.It's all a bit much. And I currently get stressed very easily. Girlfriend wants something and I'm innerly tightening up.\n\n\nI kinda don't wanna feel this way. Especially since I know I can handle all of this.\n\n\nOnly today I thought about taking care of my mental health in all of this and looking to get atop on this.\n\n\nSince overwhelmed is something I deal with yearly (:D) it seems like a good idea to get a handle on my emotions.\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n\nSo far I've noticed that I think about changing the job in an unideal way. Lots of questions I keep repeating internally to which I don't have the answers (yet).Today I tried to switch to thinking about what new job-conditions I actually want and felt better.\n\n\nThe biggest drag is not knowing about specific job offers yet. I got 5 offers from friends in the industry already and my old boss is even bothering my friend \"Whats u\/shibiku doing? Ask him. I would hire him on the spot!\"But I'd rather searched thoroughly this time. Accepting the first offer (which I did with the current offer ... which was okay, but they obscured all of the stuff I'm now unhappy with during the interview. Despite me directly asking about it ...) didn't do me good.",

My best guess, based on what I've seen and heard from his lectures and seminars, is that the listener is to learn how to make the unconscious mental processes that create an emotion conscious. Is that correct? If so, how long did it take you to learn how to do it? In his seminars he seems to expect people to do it instantly -- \"double it, double it, double it\".  \n\n\nOn a side note, using his techniques I can whip myself into a rage pretty quickly but to bring up those good feelings takes a good bit of work. Are there some emotions that are just easier to \"spin\"?",

However, I never got replies and when I told him I wasn't enjoying the task and instead it was making me feel angry or annoyed he never replied. I reported him to his Association he was under after requesting a refund. He did not even reply to that email and only replied when the association told him too. \n\n\nI was told that I don't get a refund but he now has a mark next to his name because he breeched their code of ethics. \n\n\nI am so angry, he is such a fraud.

  "title":"Intro to Self-Actualization | What do you need as a human being?",
  "text":"When we think of our \u2018needs\u2019 most of us initially think of our 'lower' needs.\n\n\nOur need food, water, sleep, exercise, money, etc.\n\n\nBut as human beings we also have 'higher' needs.  Our need to actualize our potential, our need to become the best version of ourselves, to express ourselves fully, our need to continually improve....  \n\n\nThese needs are just as real as our need for food and water --- they just operates in a different way.\n\n\nAs a coach, leader and\/or someone interested in developing your potential this is an important distinction to understand.\n\n\nThe most famous model of self-actualization is Abraham Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs model where at the bottom of the pyramid are our survival needs, above that is security, and then social, self-esteem and at the top of the pyramid are these higher 'self-actualization' needs.\n\n\nAs human beings we start at the bottom of the pyramid at our survival needs and as we gratify those sufficiently we are freed to move up to the next level.\n\n\nAn example that I use to describe this is to imagine that you are under water holding your breath.\n\n\nIn the beginning it is likely that you can really enjoy being under water. You can relax, think about your goals, reflect on your life, and just enjoy yourself.\n\n\nAs time goes on however, as your lower need for oxygen remains ungratified, more and more of your attention gets pulled toward gratifying that need.\n\n\nEventually it can reach the point where someone could lose their sense of self, lose their values, and might even consciously or unconsciously drown another individual just to get some air because every single cell in one's body becomes devoted toward that one task \u2014 meeting that lower need. \n\n\nOne of the amazing things about our lower needs is that the second that you get a deep breath of oxygen, air is the last thing on your mind. Almost immediately you are freed up to focus on other things in your life.\n\n\nThe lower needs work in this way. They unlock level upon level as you sufficiently gratify the level below: The less you have, the more you need them. The second you fulfill them, they completely drop out of consciousness.\n\n\nThis is not the same as how our self-actualization needs work. Perhaps surprisingly they work in quite the opposite way.  The more you get them the more you want them!\n\n\nThe more the painter paints, the more they want to paint.\n\n\nThe more the singer sings, the more they want to sing.\n\n\nThe more you express yourself fully the more you want to express yourself fully.\n\n\nBut there is a problem with this...\n\n\nWe are not able to visit in this 'higher' realm, let alone live there, until our lower needs are sufficiently gratified.\n\n\nEvery morning we wake up and we need to eat again. Every night we need to sleep again. Every month we need to pay our bills.\n\n\nIf you try to live at the peak without meeting your lower needs you will eventually burn out or need to divert your path. It is just not sustainable.\n\n\nIt is only when we have systems in place to consistently gratify our lower needs that we are able to free up our inner vitality to really focus on what it is that we are best at - what it is we are meant to do in this world.\n\n\nLet's take a moment of self-reflection:\n\n\n\n\nHow well are you meeting your lower needs on a consistent basis? Perhaps your focus could be on implementing strategies to meet these lower needs in a systematic way.\n\n\n\n\nWhere would you say that you are currently living in terms of Maslow's pyramid? Are you more focused on survival, security, social, or at the top of the pyramid?   This self-assessment will give you a system for knowing what to prioritize for the next stage of your development.\n\n\n\n\nAt what level are you focusing your vitality at this stage of development and is that aligned with your needs? For example if you are really focused on getting a relationship, but are unable to pay your bills you may want to reconsider your priorities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn better understanding how our needs work we can gain perspective as to what our sticking points are and we can realign our priorities at each stage of our development to make ongoing progress towards unleashing our highest and best potential as a human being.",

  "title":"6 Models to Take Your NLP to the Next Level",
  "text":"Want to go beyond the original NLP Models?  Here are 6 Neuro-Semantic models that will greatly expand your capabilities as a NLP Practitioner and Coach.\n\n\nModel #1: The Meta-States Model - For Unconscious Communication\nBeyond the traditional communication model of NLP the Meta-States model opens us to much more accurately track and transform the higher levels of mind, belief systems, inner dialogue, and all of the meta levels of the mind in a systemic and organized manner.\n\n\nAcknowledged by INLPTA in 1995 as \u201cthe most significant contribution to NLP\u201d, Meta-States model give us the ability to track back from someone\u2019s behavior and representations up to the layers and layers of thoughts in the back of the mind that govern that experience all the way back down to our resulting behavior.\n\n\nModel #2: The Axes of Change Model - For Change & Learning\nThe Axis of Change incorporates the four key mechanisms for generative change \u2013 Motivation, Decision, Creation and Solidification. Not only does it create a structured framework for coaching conversations, but it will make your blind spots as a practitioner blatantly obvious and give you a clear path to expand your personal growth, coaching, and communication skills.\n\n\nDesigned for generative change, the Axes of Change Model results in change that is sustainable without the resistance and relapse features that characterize many other models designed for more remedial change.\n\n\nThis model dramatically transformed the way that I do coaching and is a powerful change model that I use in my sales process as well as to enhance all of my other NLP techniques.\n\n\nModel #3: The Benchmarking Model \u2013 For Measurement & Implementation\nBy its nature subjective experience is... subjective!\n\n\nWould you like to learn a model that you can use to make intangible experiences more objective and measurable?\n\n\nAt its core the Neuro-Semantic Benchmarking model is based upon the ability to use the Meta-Model and to de-nominalize terms back down to their sensory based referents \u2013 but it takes this process so much farther.\n\n\nIn fact, this art has been refined over and over again in each competency based Meta-Coach Certification Training.\n\n\nThe practice of Neuro-Semantic benchmarking has massively transformed my ability to stretch my global-detail & intuitor-sensor meta-programs with truly life changing consequences.\n\n\nApplying this model allows us to take our outcomes, values, skills and experiences and make them measurable so we can better track the growth, learning and development of ourselves and those whom we work with.\n\n\nModel #4:  The Self-Actualization Quadrants - For Self-Actualization\nIf you know me at all you know that in my opinion \u2014 Self-Actualization is the highest frame within which to practice NLP, Coaching, and Neuro-Semantics.  Self-Actualization is the larger frame from in which we can check the ecology of any system or change, and when we focus on unleashing the highest and best of ourselves and our clients everything else falls into place.\n\n\nModel #5: The Matrix Model \u2013 For Systemic Thinking\nThe Matrix Model is designed as a systems model for thinking and working systemically with people, groups and organizations.  In Neuro-Semantics we use the Matrix Model for working with the multiple layers of meaning frames that create and describe the client\u2019s world so that we can \u201cfollow the energy through the system\u201d.\n\n\nStarting with any external event, the matrix model allows us to track the process of embodying that information, processing that information, metabolizing that information into energy and embodying it into the state from which our behaviors flow out of.\n\n\nWe use the Matrix Model and its 7 matrices as a template for gathering and sorting information, for profiling, modeling, and working with the systemic complexity of human experience.\n\n\nModel #6: The Facilitation Model \u2013 For Facilitating Change\nWhen you coach\/communicate with others (or yourself) do you tend to be too soft, empathetic and supportive?\n\n\nOr perhaps you fall on the other side of the spectrum overly pushing and challenging in your communications.\n\n\nThe Neuro-Semantic Facilitation Model organizes the 7 core skills of Coaching\/Communication onto the Meaning and Performance Axes so we can stretch ourselves as facilitators and take ourselves to the next level as agents of change.\n\n\nNot only that, but it \u2018facilitates\u2019 you to find your perfect balance between being ruthlessly challenging and compassionately supportive.\n\n\nWhen I first discovered this model I (like many other coaches) tended to be overly supportive in my coaching to the detriment of my clients.  Now I have the permission, capability, and experience of challenging my clients to take action and to stretch which has had dramatic effects in their (as well as my own) performance.\n\n\nAny questions? Feel free to reach out and I am happy to support!",

  "text":"As a NLP practitioner I was taught step-by-step processes\/patterns that I could do \u2018on\u2019 somebody.\n\n\nIt was completely normal in that NLP culture for me to say something like \u201cI just did NLP on him\u201d or \u201cShe just did NLP on me\u201d, or \"They just NLPed me\".\n\n\nWhen I started learning\/practicing Neuro-Semantic NLP one of the differences in culture was the shift from the focus on 'the process' to the focus on 'the person' and 'the relationship'.\n\n\nRather than practicing NLP 'on\u2019 people, we practiced our NLP 'with\u2019 people.\n\n\nA slightly different way of framing it with a massive real-world impact in my life.\n\n\nIn terms of my day to day communications and relationships this re-frame supports me in building more authentic rapport with others. \n\n\nIt supports me in building more genuinely caring relationships.  \n\n\nIt supports me in generating long term, sustainable, win-win relationships personally and professionally. \n\n\nThis reframe supports me in more healthy and respectful communication patterns and it supports me in treating others as I would like to be treated.\n\n\nIn terms of coaching relationships this way of operating supports me in building collaborative relationships with my clients in service of them and their desired outcomes. \n\n\nIt supports my clients to feel more empowered to take responsibility for their own results, increases their personal power, and it demonstrates as a role model a much more resourceful way of how to relate with other people.\n\n\nWith over ten years having passed since I shifted this way of thinking for myself I can say from my personal experience that doing NLP 'with people' has been much more powerful for me than doing NLP 'on people'.",

  "title":"How I Built My Coaching Practice",
  "text":"Are you starting your coaching practice?   Perhaps you have been coaching for some time now but still aren\u2019t as confident in your skills as you would like to be, even though you are excited to share your tools with the world?\n\n\nRecently I received a question from a client asking how I built my practice, and how I was able to build trust in myself and my skills.\nBelow is the first part of my reply...\n\n\nTo begin, I practiced at every opportunity I could. There are some skills where I needed to have someone\u2019s permission and make it more formal of a coaching session, but there were also skills that could be practiced more informally and conversationally. \n\n\nFor example, whenever I would be buying something I would practice basic rapport, listening, questioning with the person at the register. I would practice shifting the state of somebody sitting next to me on the bus, at the crosswalk or at the cafe. Any opportunity I got I would practice for free.\n\n\nI asked anyone and everyone if I could practice X technique with them or do Y process to help them achieve an outcome.  \n\n\nA basic script of what I would ask people was something along the lines of:\n\u201cHi! I have been training as a coach and was wondering if you would be open to experiencing a 25 minute session with me. Worst case scenario things are exactly the same but we could potentially help you make a big impact in your life that otherwise wouldn\u2019t have happened.  Would you be open to this?\u201d\n\n\nOr \u201cHey, I learned a process that could help you achieve X. Would you be open to experiencing this with me? It only takes 15-20 minutes. Worst case scenario you end up exactly the same but many people share that this has had a profound impact for them.  Would you be open to experience this with me?\u201d\n\n\nI found that having a time frame was important because you don\u2019t want it to go on forever.  Whether it is 15 minutes, 30 minutes, or an hour, I would invite people to experience free sessions with me and at the end I would ask them for their feedback.\n\n\n\n\nWhat did I do that you loved in that session?\n\n\nWhat was the best skill I demonstrated?\n\n\nWhat could I have said, done, or asked that would have taken your experience to the next level?\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, after 10 years of experience as a coach I still ask these questions after many of my sessions.  Honest feedback is one of the best ways to increase your competence. And if they share that they enjoyed the session, you can always ask for a testimonial and\/or referral. If you sense that they got a lot of value you can also invite them to work with you more formally. \n\n\nIf you are afraid to ask people out of fear of making mistakes, or have a hard time separating yourself from your behavior these resources may help: \n\n\n\n\nEmbrace Your Fallibilities: \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zXYUpGPDoa0\n\n\nThere is no such thing as failure: \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=VwBbS5VNbrc\n\n\nThe power of acceptance: \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bur5JfnshtM\n\nHow to overcome perfectionism and take action: \nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=QQdpHLoFrOQ\n\n\n\n\nFeel free to leave your questions and comments below and if you like I can publish more on this topic.

  "title":"New Here. Some Questions...",
  "text":"My first question would be how best to absorb the information in NLP. It's a lot, even going by what's in the NLP For Dummies book. I'm familiar with the hypnosis aspect, but the rest is a lot for me to take in.\n\n\nSecond question... given what little I do know about NLP, I've seen a lot of information and techniques from a man whose material was required reading for a course I was taking. His name is Dr. H. Norman Wright. I'm wondering if anyone has any information on his studying NLP. His model of the brain, advice on building rapport, and even some techniques he shows on reducing stress, seem like they're based on NLP (one of his techniques I recognized as hypnosis), and he recommends hypnotic training like EMDR.\n\n\nThird question... I've noticed that there are various ways to group together Milton Model and hypnotic techniques phenomenologically, such as yes\/no sets and pacing\/leading as a following phenomenon. Has anyone else noticed this, and does it make for easier learning?\n\n\nI look forward to any insight on these questions",

  "title":"Creating the Space for Your Coaching Clients to Speak Their Truth &amp; Open Up about their Real Issues",
  "text":"I was recently asked by a client, \u201cHow do I build the rapport, safety and vulnerability in my coaching so a client can feel safe to speak their truths?\u201d.\n\n\nBeyond the basic NLP rapport techniques there are many coaching skills & states that support this process which is so crucial to being effective as a coach.\n\n\nAWARENESS OF THE CONTEXT My first consideration would be the context with which the person came to you. Did they come by choice? Were they forced to work with you? Did they come to you tentatively or with desire? Did they invest money to have this meeting? All of these factors will help determine the level of \u2018rapport\u2019 right out of the gate. The more desiring, willing, and invested they are as a general rule the more open they will be to share more deeply.\n\n\nDEVELOPING YOUR SKILLS OF LISTENING AND SUPPORTING Most people are not aware of their \u2018real\u2019 problems\u2019 or \u2018real goals\u2019 \u2014 or at least they aren\u2019t very clear on how to communicate them. So they will test you with smaller problems\/pseudo problems and see how you respond before bringing the \u2018real\u2019\/\u2019deeper\u2019 issues to the table. How do you handle these?\n\n\nDo you default quickly to giving advice? Or do you actively & non-judgmentally listen, ask exploratory questions, acknowledge what you are hearing, check that you are understanding correctly, summarize what you have heard, etc. Do you separate out pseudo problems & symptoms from the real issues and hear what isn\u2019t being stated directly?\n\n\nDo you call them out when you calibrate that they are being inauthentic, shallow, or playing it safe and invite them to get real? These skills will allow them to feel safe, supported, understood and build trust in your competence & caring so they will be more comfortable to share their deeper, more meaningful issues.\n\n\nDEVELOPING YOUR DEEP QUESTIONING SKILLS Ask deeper questions that pull them one level deeper than they have shared and see if you have resistance or if they follow your lead. In many contexts it is our job as a \u2018coach\u2019 to invite the deeper sharing rather than to \u2018wait for it\u2019.\n\n\nDEVELOPING YOUR SKILL OF FRAMING Setting frames up front can help accelerate this process. Let them know that your conversations are confidential (because most of your clients refer their friends and colleagues to you or whatever reason is authentic to you). Let them know up front that you\u2019re going to ask them deeper questions to get to the heart of what is most important. Let them know up front that the more real they are, the more real\/authentic their results will be, etc.\n\n\nWhat frames can you set at the beginning of your sessions\/meetings that will allow them to feel more comfortable\/help resolve some resistance they may be feeling to authentically share?\n\n\nDEVELOPING YOUR COACHING STATE Lastly for now, how well do you unconditionally accept your clients? How well can you appreciate them as people and even appreciate their \u2018problems\u2019\/parts of themselves that even they don\u2019t appreciate about themselves yet? How much can you see them as a unique and sacred individual on a growth journey? How much do you put yourself aside and so they can sense it is all about them rather than about you, your ego, or you getting results. And again, how well can you \u2018just listen\u2019 and explore without the need to change anything. All of these things will support them in feeling safe and supported and accelerate the process of opening up. (All of these states can be cultivated more deeply in yourself with the tools in our State Elicitation course).\n\n\nAll of these skills and states will support you in your coaching to create the safe space your clients need to open up and discover the real and significant issues in their life that will create meaningful change to make your work so valuable they can\u2019t help but actively promote and praise you and your work.",

  "text":"So me and my buddy have the following opposing views:\n\n\nHis:\n\n\n\"At the beginning you are an uninhibited lightbulb of childlike motivation, curiosity and pure energy. Then more or less layers of rules, habits and trauma are put on top. Dimming the level of energy, flexibility of actions and range of emotions. Peeling back those layers of indoctrination, bad habits and unsolved traumata to reveal the uninhibited you is the way to go. Once your free of the old ways, new ways form automatically.\"  \n\n\nvs.\n\n\nMine:\n\n\n\"You take your current level of extra time and energy, however little it may be and invest it into a new behaviour or thought. You are somewhat aware of what works against you and somewhat aware what does work for you. So you keep repeating what works for you, cause that will make you happier and more energetic. Being happier and more energetic you tend to make even more life affirming decisions. Building up a new way of life like a castle. Somehow forgetting the old behaviours and coping mechanisms you used to have, by finding new and better ways to live life.\"  \n\n\nCondendsed down it's \"Build the new, old gets forgotten on the way\" vs. \"Clean the old, the new comes automatically\"  \n\n\nAll in all we both come to the same conclusion. By raising your well-being, life gets better. We just differ on the way to raise that well-being.\n\n\nParadoxically enough, he tends to implement new behaviours through discipline really easy, yet they have seldom much effect (think Jojo-Diet). While I can take his approach of \"cleaning up the past\" with ease and talk about traumatic events in such a positive manner, it's reworked into assets instead of hindrances, yet I see no benefit.\n\n\nWhat are your thoughts from a personal or an NLP-Perspective?\nDigging, taking what's there, creating completly new, ...?",

  "title":"Thoughts on on my self-NLP challenges.",
  "text":"I was certified as a practitioner in June of 2020 and I decided to take some time to work on myself before I start working with clients.  Despite my best efforts I have had a hard time making changes stick.  Frankly, I have reverted on 99% of the change work I have done.  The only thing I have made stick was silly.  I renewed my taste for an album that I played out more than twenty years ago by mapping it across to something new and exciting.  (Pretty Hate Machine by Nine Inch Nails for those who are curious.)  As a result I finally got around to playing with something that my trainer called tasking.\n  I haven&#039;t seen this discussed anywhere so I&#039;m posting it here in hopes that I  can help someone to help themselves.  It was taught to me that getting the client where they want to be while in the session is on the practitioner but once the client is back out in the world the responsibility for staying there is on them.  This is where tasking comes in.  Tasking is assigning the client (of in this case, yourself) homework designed to keep them in the effective mindset that was created during the session.  In my personal case, I have a list of statements of intent on my closet door that I read multiple times per day with the intent of taking the meaning of the statement into my current state.  It&#039;s kind of like an affirmation however it works better than affirmations alone.  In this case, I have created a change with NLP and am using the statement of intent to reaffirm the change that I made rather than trying to convince myself of something by repetition alone.\n The second thing that I want to stress is for those who lean more toward the kinesthetic end of things.  When I talk about the statements on my closet door I mean that I write them in a way that I will feel when I read them.  Then, As I read the statements of intent I take a second to really dwell in how the intent of the statement feels.  Over a short time you will be better able to sustain the feeling for longer and longer.\n Third, even though it is taught that when mapping across, you map across the visual submodalities don&#039;t be afraid to try mapping across auditory and kinesthetic also.  Mapping across kinesthetic submodalities is how I got myself to enjoy Pretty Hate Machine again.",

  "title":"Loneliness - What triggers makes us actually think our social needs are not satisfied and how to change all of it (Discussion)",
  "text":"Inspiration was this video from kurzgesagt\n\n\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/n3Xv_g3g-mA\n\n\nShort-Synopsis: \"Like hunger, loneliness is a indicating pain that some need is not met.\"\n\n\nThen it gets into how loneliness can warp the individuals perception of social interactions towards \"She didn't like me\"\/\"I don't belong\"\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nSo given the mighty sword of \"Your brain can't differentiate between real experience and thought\" that's on the core of many NLP-Techniques, is it possible to satisfy our inner hunger for social acceptance through NLP?\n\n\nI've been toying around with this a lot, cause (I'm crazy) ... my social skills are not the best. So I have built many behaviors around this.\n\n\n______\n\n\nStructuring the inner world towards \"Nobody likes me\" - while searching for proof in the real world to justify that belief - is described in the aforementioned video.\n\n\nWhich is easy to do, since lots of social interactions can have something that can be misinterpreted and dwelled upon. Very easy to have resistance towards something and then gnaw on that one remark - that sounded like something your dad said to you when you were little - for the rest of the evening.\n\n\n______\n\n\nRestructuring said world towards something more healthy like \"Some people like me, some love me and a few find me attractive\" is a very doable endeavor and affirmation that triggers happiness in me. (Worked a lot on this, so I can swallow it somewhat without resistance. Tweaking the audio-submodalities towards a believable, pleasant voice was good here)\n\n\n______\n\n\nThe questions would be:\n\n\nTo which degree should we built our inner world of thoughts towards something that pleases us vs. changing the reality for real?\n\n\nWhat would be the best way of changing our inner world towards the better?\n\n\nIs one ever satisfied with their social interactions and feels constantly like \"they belong\" and \"are loved\" or is one never to be satisfied no matter how much external validation is given?\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\n______ \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nMeta-Commentary\n\n\nAfter this the post becomes more of a rant. The top part is the structured questions and talking topics I wanted to share.\n\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nMy story here:\n\n\nThinking of loneliness as motivating social pain. Without it I wouldn't think much about widening or maintaining my social circle, since for me it's sometimes more work than fun. While I'm socially able and people want to hang out with me, it seldom gives me much. Which is also the main thing girlfriends have broken up with me over \"emotionally unavailable, like a robot.\"\n\n\nMakes sense, my dad has 0 friends - my mom likes the drama of people for entertainment and has a gaggle of girlfriends, but keeps them at arms length. They live for their business and only have each other (and their dog, which they adore). So my internal values are skewed towards the same ideals. Or as my first girlfriend described it \"Your family is the coldest I have ever met. Their not dementors in itself, but their presence sure makes the windows freeze over\" I did get two hugs from my mom.\n\n\nSo it's not completely frozen :D\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nLet's say the main hiccup with social interactions that leads to pain is resistance.\n\n\nThe breaking of rapport because the other has shown or said something that doesn't sit right with us.\n\n\nLet's say my distant aunt goes on a rant about how \"Covid-Masks are bullshit\"\n\n\nI know she throws out this generalization of her beliefs, mainly because she can't just swallow the threat of covid. Covid restrictions destroyed her whole service industry business and she didn't have any income since 12.2019 and probably wont have any income till Summer. She's vicious and the tonality in her statement shows.\n\n\nI would like to break rapport, cause simplifying it to \"Masks are bullshit\" doesn't sit right with me. I would like to get the statement right and bulldoze over her whole statement with \"the truth\" (my truth). But that doesn't get me anywhere in terms of rapport and social joy.\n\n\nLeaving myself behind to go into her rabbit hole of frustration and anger would connect me with her, but I get a feeling of cringe and mini-vomit just thinking about it. Not really worth it\n\n\nWhile I actually haven't talked to that aunt in 2 years. I have this exact problem in almost of all of my social interactions. Nobody fits perfect and my inability to be flexible, go into their world and be interested into going into their world causes me loneliness.\n\n\nI have recognized that this is a problem in my life and are looking for ways to change this. Fiddling around with my inner world of thought and beliefs seems like a good start. Especially since forcing myself towards social groups is an ongoing theme in my life, which I dislike most of the time.\n\n\nThe only social situation where I listen like a hawk to what people are saying and are interested is the NLP Groups I managed in my city (Died due to covid :\/). Luckily my job will give me enough financial freedom to travel to a bigger city and hopefully get a bigger NLP group going again after Covid subdues (2024 *fingers crossed*). So that's my current hope to get a social circle going that I share an interest with.\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\n______",

There's a number of situations where I can see myself needing this:  \n\n\n\n\nAfter work (when I'm burnt out from doing sales all day)  \n\n\n\n\nWhen I'm getting in the zone to run my small businesses, where I require some extra motivation to do a variety of work activities(speaking with suppliers, cold-calling customers, admin. work, tech. support, etc.)  \n\n\n\n\nWhen I need to be assertive, deal with confrontational tasks, or things that provoke my anxiety  \n\n\n\n\nWhen I'm going through a \"destructive\" state, like the neighbors making too much noise but can't ask them to turn it down any lower, or when I'm feeling helpless and repeatedly more angry (as mentioned)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can tell all of this stuff is related to me internally. I'm not looking to guide others to entering a more resourceful state, I really just want to command it within myself, so I can better tackle obstacles of my life.   \n\n\nKeep in mind that, having been in the sales industry for about a decade of my life already, I probably already have a basic background of NLP. I also work with a therapist who has an NLP background and explained some of these things to me, like pattern interrupts.  \n\n\n\n\nAre there any good books for working on this sort of thing?  \n\n\n\n\nSince I'm looking specifically to work on things internally, do I even need to read any longer books? If not, what are some guides, websites, blogs, videos, etc. that can be just as helpful?  \n\n\n\n\nWhat are some ways where I can work on triggering a resourceful state?",

Doing my best to relax and realize my connection with everything... But yesterday imo was one of the most eye opening experiences so far..\n\n\nMy children were outside playing in the rain. They invited me to come outside to join them. Of course i agreed. However, as the water hit me, I tensed up.. As every drop hit me, i stayed tensed as if i was gonna be in trouble for relaxing. I watched my children play and enjoyed watching them play. When the urge got too great, I would go back under the awning of our house and watch. A couple times the toddler would walk over to me and pull me back out into the rain. To which I followed, stomped in the puddles or let the rain hit me again for a little while. Only to return to the safety of the house after giving in to my subconscious. \n\n\nWhen I realized i was as soaked as i could stand myself to be.. I went inside and dried off.. Both feeling negative for not being able to stay outside longer and for not enjoying being outside with my children. I immediately start probing myself for the source(s) of my feelings and resistance to enjoy myself in such a simple situation. I  finally come to a concluding idea that Bc I dont deserve to enjoy the experience bc im not making the money or in the position I would prefer to be in to \"have fun\" Immediately getting upset with myself for this idea only to come to the realization that i have not yet changed this underlying belief about money.

For any mom, hearing that was unacceptable and wanted to find other answers, so the psychiatrist gave the mom two months to find an answer to Peter\u2019s problem or he will have to change schools because his reactions are influencing his classmates negatively.\n\n\nPeter\u2019s problem was that he was hallucinating a nun, visually and auditorily, VALAK from the movie The Conjuring, that caused him to have Panic Attacks, scream, and freeze. This had been going for 2 years on a daily basis, since his parents started the process of divorce. \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\nValak from the Conjuring or as Peter said from the Greek Bible as he never saw the movie.\n\n\nPeter\u2019s mom, lets call her Julia had a friend who knew me, who knows I had the knack with experimenting with challenging cases. Although I am not a therapist, as a Coach and NLP Trainer, I have worked with challenging cases in collaboration with therapists for the better part of the last seven years, and got some interesting results as my frame of mind was different than theirs. \n\n\nDiscovery Session, Peter and Julia come together. He shares his story and how long it had been happening. I deliberately misunderstood the name of the nun, and called her the name of a cheese \u201cKashkaval\u201d, this is a PCW (Provocative Change Works) stance that helps in lightening up the mood and helping the client get out of his state a bit.\n\n\nWe did 4 sessions with intervals of between 2 weeks to 4 months in between and here is a summary.\n\n\nSession One: We worked on changing the connection of the emotion to certain images in his mind. \n\n\nResult: He started seeing the Nun once every 2 days instead of daily\n\n\nSession Two: Using the fast phobia model \u2013 we worked on changing a specific scene in his mind that started with the moment he started getting scared, and ended at the peak, towards starting way before the fear started where he was safe, and until he reached safety again after the peak.\n\n\nResult: He started seeing the nun once every two weeks, but still believed it was out there not a figment of his imagination. \n\n\nSession Three: Mostly was a provocative conversation, getting him to think of different things in different ways. Two main points played a role here. His biggest trigger was when he was studying Maths and reached a point where he could not understand anymore. He was afraid to fail. So, we did a how to study Maths session a week later that was not related to change work, just a mental strategy session on how to solve problems. The second point was a question I asked \u201cHave you ever taken a picture of \u201cCrispy\u201d?\u201d The nun\u2019s new name because her skin reminded him of crispy chicken. His answer was no.\n\n\nResult: Two weeks later Peter sends me 3 Whatsapp Pictures telling me, that\u2019s her, can you see, can you see? I asked where? Can you mark her for me so I can see her too? And the more he tried, the more it disappeared. And I did not hear from Peter or Julia for a while.\n\n\nSession Four: Three months down the line, Julia calls me and says that Peter really wants to see you. We agreed on a date. Peter had grown in length, lost weight, and had asked his mom to change schools as he was not comfortable in the environment any more. When I asked about \u201cCrispy\u201d, his reply was: \u201cWell I only saw her once, I was camping with my friends, and she showed up in the forest far away, waving her hand as if she was saying goodbye\u2026\u201d\n\n\nThat\u2019s when I said goodbye to Peter, knowing that the best way to help someone change something is listening to how they create and maintain the problem, as PCW creator Nick Kemp says, and when heard well, change happens much quicker than expected and in much simpler more straightforward ways.",

So I'm starting to do it now in my life. I'm having trouble with this anchoring\/trigger thing.\n\n\nI want to create new habits in my life, but I don't know which NLP technique to use to do it (again, I'm new to this stuff, so certainly I don't know many of the NLP techniques available). \n\n\nTried many Google on trying to find a NLP technique to create new habits, but only found results on breaking bad habits and making new, good ones, using the swish pattern. The thing is: some habits I want to do, doesn't necessarily replace any bad habits I'm currently doing.\n\n\nFor example: I want to make a breathing exercise that I only have time available to do during my commute to work. So, I want to create this new habit. Generally what I do in the commute to work is reading books or watch video tutorials, which are good habits that I don't want to stop doing. I need to create a trigger or an anchor to make this new habit and remind me to do it everyday and I need to feel good about doing it. I've tried alarms in my cellphone but they didn't quite work, because I'm not always at the same time in my commute to work everyday. I need to do it in a certain place. \n\n\nThere's also this technique of comparing and modifying what you want to do, to something you would like to do. But I don't know if this is \"permanent\". The swish pattern has this thing that creates an trigger that makes things automatically and you've permanently made that habit stick (which worked really fine for me).\n\n\nSo can you use the swish pattern to make new habits (use the \"bad image\" as the image of you not doing the habit you want to do versus the image of you doing it) or there's a NLP technique to creating new habits?",

Hard to believe, but the process does often feel darn-near spiritual at times.\n\n\nAre there some other books out there where I might explore other NLP techniques that explain how to structure words in ways that help to guide people to accessing deeply felt, personally-intuitive states?

I'm a massage therapist, but stuck as an employee because i haven't been able to do any networking or sell myself.  I have the potential to be a really good life coach, but again i have to be able to approach people before I can do that.  And with anything NLP-related, you're in business for yourself.  There are a few directories, but for the most part you have to win over all your clients, they don't just come to you as if you were employed somewhere.\n\n\nso NLP training may or may not be a good next step; that's why i'm posting here about it. I'm continuing with the energy work, as that's been essential to get me to where i am now, and i may need to stick with that for a while before doing NLP training.  but i've made enough progress that it's at least worth looking into now.  any thoughts?",

But many of the people I\u2019ve encountered who work directly under him are not, and this seems very suspicious to me. \n\n\nFor example, one of the top NLP people in the country was at a seminar I attended a few years back and was onstage before Richard. The guy had \nzero\n stage presence or charisma whatsoever. His delivery was flat and boring, and so the audience just talked over and ignored him as if to say \u201cshut up and bring Richard out already.\u201d\n\n\nThe same goes for one of his female colleagues with whom he wrote a book. I watched a talk she gave and she was stiff, nervous and devoid of any magnetism whatsoever. Shouldn\u2019t her NLP expertise have allowed her to have the audience feeding out of the palm of her hand? Shouldn\u2019t she have been cool, calm and confident instead of tentative and awkward?\n\n\nI\u2019m not trying to attack these people for no reason, but to ask an important question: if NLP can teach you to become charming and charismatic, why did two people who have \npersonally worked under Richard for years\n completely fail to make an impact on the audience when I saw them on these occasions?",

  "text":"Hey.\n\n\nI've been reading Way of the Wolf and Jordan Belfort talks a bit about using NLP and anchors to manage mental states of peak performance, but I'm slightly confused about the details of how this works. He says to anchor yourself with some sort of stimuli when you're at a state of peak performance to be able to bring that state back at a later time, but it's slightly unclear how exactly this happens.\n\n\nHe gives this example of an experiment with a dog, where they would ring a bell every time they fed the dog and eventually the dog would start to salivate just at the sound of the bell, but it's unclear whether the bell triggers a memory about food for the dog, whether it directly triggers a mental state of hunger or whether it triggers a mental state of hunger through the memory of the food.\n\n\nWill using an anchor set at a mental state of peak performance help bring back the memory of the given situtation that brought you to that state of peak performance and then thinking about that memory will help trigger that same mental state or will using your anchor just bring you right back that mental state without necessarily having to be tied to a specific memory and without having to think about that memory?\n\n\nWhat exactly is an anchor supposed to trigger and how can it help me achieve peak performance on demand?\n\n\nI realise that this stuff probably isn't down to an exact science that works the same every time, but I'm just trying to grasp the details of how this stuff works to give me the best chances of success.\n\n\nI would really appreciate some expertise on this matter.

  "text":"My NLP style is entirely based on changing yourself to improve, not to affect other people. Hopefully it will be interesting anyway :)\n\n\n\n\nSo you have 3 layers of self that you can control. Your body, mind, and awareness (or consciousness etc).\n\n\nYour awareness is the one to set the theme of what you want in life, your mind brings up thoughts according to the theme you set, and your body actually does the manual labor to move closer to your goals. \n\n\nFor body improvement, practice is key. That's about it. Muscle memory and skills. Just basic stuff. \n\n\nFor mind improvement, you need to see which actions get you which results. Plan for the future, plan efficiently, to achieve goals faster with new strategies. Thinking and planning and deciding HOW to do things. \n\n\nAwareness improvement is similar at a higher level, you can see which goals move your life in which direction, and the effects that your goals and strategies have on the whole thing. You can change the course of your life by deciding what types of goals will help you, and what types of goals will not help, and setting your mental state to be open to the good stuff and closed to the bad stuff. \n\n\nAnd thats about it. The way of improving every thing. If you have any thoughts or ideas to improve this please let me know! \n\n\nI know this is a wall of text sorry haha.",

I listened to it last night and this morning. My mind has only ever been this quiet when I was in a deep meditation and thought I found God. And with a quiet mind it's incredibly easy to get done what you want to get done so I guess in a sense it worked but...\n\n\nI'd like to an expert or someone more knowledge about this than me to check the authenticity of this if such a thing is possible. Even though it technically did what it said it would I still want to know it's not like deleting parts of my brain and prepping me to be a mindless soldier when I hear a trigger word when WW3 starts. Because I reasonably fear these things. \n\n\nOkay thank you.",

  "text":"HAVING A TEAM MINDSET\n\n\nMay 30, 2018 | \nJames Pesch\n | \nNo Comments\n | \nBlog\n\n\nSCIENCE OF SUCCESS\n\n\nHAVING A TEAM MINDSET\n\n\nINTRO\n\n\nAs a Tulsa based Life Coach, Executive Coach, & Business Consultant I have spent many years trying to discover \u201cBETTER\u201d ways of modeling successful ways of behaving and believing. When I was a kid, I had several different sets of parents and grandparents who helped shape my ability to realize that children can\u2019t do anything right,\n\n\nanywhere\n.\n\n\nIf the child, let\u2019s call him Yames; if Yames behaves one way in one home, or classroom, it is perfectly acceptable and Yames can expect to be treated fairly or as all the other equally loved and respected people in the dynamic, BUT Yames can go to the next home or classroom and behave the EXACT same way and learn that the act is \u201cselfish,\u201d OR and this is the worst and most unnecessary guilt you can heap upon a young mammal who is trying to learn how to survive is to tell them their learned behavior is\n\n\n\u201c\nevil\n,\u201d or \u201c\nmean\n.\u201d\n\n\nWhen Yames acts or behaves in ANY manner, whatever the behavior is, when first began, it was most likely a \nlearned\n behavior. Let me give you an example, the act of throwing a toy at the wall when someone was mad was introduced to Yames when he was already 7 or 8, far too late in development for him to have adopted a similar coping skill, but as Yames watched his new family hurl items into walls and floors whenever they would get upset, he knew that this was a destructive and seemingly juvenile way to process internal frustrations, but Yames could also perceive that this was not evil or selfish. It was all learned. You could trace it back to childhood behaviors which they could all clearly recall seeing acted out by a caretaker when questioned after the fact.\n\n\nLast week, as I was jumping into my car to speed away to my next \u201cthing,\u201d I said something to a friend that pissed them off. I said,\n\n\n>\u201cHey what\u2019re you guys up to this weekend? We should hang out or something.\u201d\n\n\nThis casual invitation is a habit I picked up in my 20\u2019s when I discovered that most people feel left out or unimportant to most other people. One friend was disappointed and crying to me one evening about how no one liked her or invited her to attend parties, she was mad at me for not inviting her along, and since I always want others to know that I am an open and inviting person who loves company no matter what I am up to and no matter what we are doing, I adopted a habit of inviting others along.\n\n\nWell, last week, in order to follow my habit of inviting, I messed up and asked someone along who needed more intimate and specific plans because of a chronic illness which makes it difficult for her to commit to evening plans, which I did not provide and did not intend to provide as this was just as honest an invitation as it was casual. I just offer this casual offering to anyone whose company, I enjoy. I want them to know they are welcome to be around me anytime they get the urge and that I am easy to please with activities because the people who are there are the main reason I attend any event or do anything outside studying and reading or exercising.\n\n\nThis was when I learned about systematizing a powerful way of adopting a Team Mentality.\n\n\nBEING ON A TEAM\n\n\nOne thing football did positively for me was to help me learn what it means to have a role on a team and the goal of that team being bigger than any one role. The other factor I received from my days of colliding head to head with other hormone raging high schoolers was definitely brain damage,\u00a0 based merely upon all the most recent studies. So, you might not be able to make these next few paragraphs to make any cohesive sense, but do try. If this starts to sound silly, don\u2019t panic, we will get to a workable and applicable way to do this.\n\n\nBeing a Tulsa Executive Coach\u00a0isn\u2019t easy, one thing I started to realize was that our high school coaches never taught us how to play the game the wrong way; we spent all of our time rehearsing the Best ways to tackle, the Best ways to run, the Best ways to block, pass, catch, throw, and the list goes on and on, but here is the critical aspect of what I am sharing.: We didn\u2019t focus on the wrong way of doing things EVEN when we executed the wrong way. The whistle would blow and we would hear,\n\n\n>\u201cLine up. Run it AGAIN.\u201d\n\n\nWe knew someone screwed up, but it didn\u2019t REALLY matter who or what they did wrong, every man on the squad focused even more intently on their role and knew that focusing on executing your own role perfectly was all you could do to try to ensure that it would be executed perfectly. This was a great training system for me to apply to every area of my life. If something works; try to duplicate it.\n\n\nAPPLICATION\n\n\nIn my own life, I found a way to look at my family like a Team. I recently discovered how amazing my family is.\n\n\nNo really.\n\n\nI was always looking for ways to improve our\n\n\n\n\nquality of life,\n\n\nsuccess at work,\n\n\nschool,\n\n\npeacefulness, etc.\n\n\n\n\nSo, I would focus on what areas needed to improve and what we were doing wrong. I spent a decade being a really crappy Team member and an even worse Coach because I didn\u2019t know I was on a Team. I wasn\u2019t applying the successful model which took us from 1-9 to 7-3, losing 2 of those losses and our final game to the State Champs by a closer margin than any other team on their march to victory. We focused on the great attributes of our Team and we focused on executing the correct way. The best way. When we failed, we doubled our mental intent. We didn\u2019t have time to wallow, the average football play lasts 7 seconds. You don\u2019t get time to relive that mistake. Get over it, shake it off, and play like a champion because you are one as long as you don\u2019t quit.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nWe applied this model to our home. We cheer for one another and look for ways to do things correctly when we fail instead of beating ourselves or one another over the head with guilt and shame to try to rectify learned behaviors. Take a moment and see if there is a way for you to support those Teammates in your life that may not know they are your team mates. Give them an opportunity to feel what it\u2019s like to be cheered for, celebrate their victories as if they were your own, and tell them all the great qualities they have and can use to achieve their goals and watch the floor of the whole village rise.\n\n\nBe Your Own Hero by adopting a Team Mentality.\n\n\n***Having a Team Mindset LIVE Video***\n\n\nJames Pesch\n\n\nJAMES PESCH WELCOMES YOU BACK!\n\n\nKEYNOTE SPEAKER | BUSINESS COACH | CORPORATE TRAINER | SALES TRAINER | HUMAN PERSUASION EXPERT | LINGUIST | NEUROLINGUISTIC PROGRAMMER (NLP) EXPERT | HUMAN BEHAVIOR EXPERT | TUTOR | LIFE COACH | DECEPTION DETECTION TRAINER | HR & PERSONNEL COMMUNICATION ANALYST | TULSA BUSINESS CONSULTANT | TULSA BUSINESS MASTERY EXPERT | TULSA\u2019S MOST ENTERTAINING SPEAKER | EDUCATIONAL INSTRUCTOR | TULSA BUSINESS COACH | EXECUTIVE CONSULTANT | BODY LANGUAGE, POSTURE, & MICROEXPRESSION COACH\n\n\nJames is a Human Behavioral Specialist living in Tulsa, who is skilled in Linguistics, NLP, Mentalism, & Psychology creating content so YOU WILL \u201cBe your own HERO.\u201d -James Pesch\n\n\nThe PATREON PAGE\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u25ba \nhttps:\/\/www.patreon.com\/jamespesch\n\n\nThe Website\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u25ba \nhttps:\/\/www.jamespesch.com\n\n\nTwitter\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u25ba \nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/jamesppesch\n\n\nFacebook\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u25ba \nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/mindninjaJP\n\n\nLinkedIn\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u25ba \nhttps:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/jamespesch\n\n\nYOUR SUPPORT MEANS EVERYTHING!",

I was heartbroken because everything I knew was about to change. I never felt responsible for the separation, however, I still did not want it to happen. I couldn\u2019t control the environment I was living in nor could I control the changes that were coming.\n\n\nAll of this began to create a story within my mind that initially brought me severe internal conflict and emotional anxiety. Then, a story teller came into my life whose parents were divorced, and they told me that I would NOW be getting 2 birthday parties, 2 Christmases, & 2 summer vacations; now, that person was wrong about how awesome it would be, but for a brief moment, someone told me that a terrible situation had a silver lining and I let myself believe it and IMMEDIATELY, my anxiety went away.\n\n\nThat small reframe was the start of a powerful Linguistic tool that has been the secret sauce to what I can do in an area where so many others battle and now I am sharing it with you to empower you to Be Your Own Hero.\n\n\nTELLING YOUR STORY\n\n\nWhen I first learned that I too was a story teller, I had no idea what a mirror neuron was. I had no idea that I, along with many like me, was very literally able to shift the way people felt about their circumstances using vivid imagery & by changing perspectives. Let me show you how this works. Try this along with me to see what I mean, most people are great at this and can experience this powerful tool Easily and Confidently.\n\n\nAs you read this now, you will begin to notice that there is a real and powerful internal energy welling up within you, and as that feeling now begins to move & shift you\u2019ll find that this perfectly normal, and you are safe and fine. \u00a0I\u2019d like for you to allow yourself now to notice how ready you are to change the voice within to that more powerful and motivational pattern that you have been seeking. Use that energy within you now to generate all the strength and creativity you have to change your Story.\n\n\nTHE POWER of YOUR STORY\n\n\nDid you feel that? On a scale from 1 to 10 how intense was the energy inside you? Could you, if you focused your mind on it, increase that feeling?\n\n\nAs you consider the moments when you have criticized yourself and meticulously scrutinized your own flaws, I want you to consider what it would have sounded like to have someone like me very literally standing next to you and saying,\n\n\n>\u201cYes, of course you have faults. We all do, but let\u2019s face the fact that you are pretty incredible, kind, smart, & capable of achieving anything you set your mind to.\u201d\n\n\nSometimes, if we can\u2019t see our own story differently, it can help to imagine someone else who could see things differently and allow that story to play in our mind for a moment or two.\n\n\nALLOWING ANOTHER to TELL OUR STORY\n\n\nHow would it have looked if every time you began to have doubts about yourself if someone like me were there to look at you and say,\n\n\n>\u201cYou have got this. I know you have whatever it takes, and I am so proud of you for giving it your all every single day?\u201d \u201cYou are special and deserve to pursue what you really want.\u201d\n\n\nWould that have changed how you felt about you. Does it change how you feel about you, now?\n\n\nThere was a movie from my youth called SideKicks where the Protagonist would imagine or day dream Chuck Norris there to help him through difficult circumstances and situations. As a child, I was most fascinated with why he chose Chuck Norris, but the real lesson was burned into my mind: \nPerspective.\n Story telling is all about perspective. Barry, the hero in the movie began actually training, in his spare time, with a real kung fu master and because of the imagery and daydreams, he was motivated enough to fulfill the dreams in \u201creality.\u201d\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nWhatever you focus on in your story will become your reality. In fact, isn\u2019t it true that even now, when you focus on the greatness inside of you, the integrity, work ethic, and memories from all those who have contributed to who you are, don\u2019t you become overwhelmed with a sense of purpose and power? And this new perspective causes a new voice that you are beginning to hear now in your own mind which forces you to consider what your life would be like if firstly, in your circumstances, you began to see the greatness within you rather than the problems in your environment?\n\n\nUse this technique of story telling to change the way you see your environment. Believe me, if you can dream it, you can achieve it. So stop the negative self-talk and\n\n\n***CLICK HERE FOR VIDEO TUTORIAL***\n\n\nBe Your Own Hero.\n\n\n\n\nJames Pesch\n\n\nJAMES PESCH WELCOMES YOU BACK!\n\n\nKEYNOTE SPEAKER | BUSINESS COACH | CORPORATE TRAINER | SALES TRAINER | HUMAN PERSUASION EXPERT | LINGUIST | NEUROLINGUISTIC PROGRAMMER (NLP) EXPERT | HUMAN BEHAVIOR EXPERT | TUTOR | LIFE COACH | DECEPTION TRAINER | HR & PERSONNEL COMMUNICATION ANALYST | TULSA BUSINESS COACH | TULSA CONSULTANT | TULSA\u2019S BEST SPEAKER | MOTIVATIONAL INFLUENCER\n\n\nJames is a Human Behavioral Specialist skilled in Linguistics, NLP, Mentalism, & Psychology creating content so YOU WILL \u201cBe your own HERO.\u201d -James Pesch\n\n\nThe PATREON PAGE\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u25ba \nhttps:\/\/www.patreon.com\/jamespesch\n\n\nThe Website\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u25ba \nhttps:\/\/www.jamespesch.com\n\n\nTwitter\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u25ba \nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/jamesppesch\n\n\nFacebook\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u25ba \nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/mindninjaJP\n\n\nLinkedIn\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u25ba \nhttps:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/jamespesch\n\n\nYOUR SUPPORT MEANS EVERYTHING!",

Belfort discusses the importance of self-management, which I think we can all agree is vital in order to sustain a business. \nOne thing that caught my attention and actually brought me to this subreddit, was his avocation of NLP. \n\n\nBelfort claimed that by triggering a certain sense during a point of 'absolute certainty', it would be possible to bring back that very feeling on demand. Of course this caught my interest. I mean, who wouldn't want to be able to recall a time that they felt unstoppable, whenever you want?\n\n\nBelfort recommended a more niche form of NLP Anchoring, known as Olfactory Anchoring (anchoring via the sense of smell), as it the neural-receptors in the nose can be strongly attached to memory (..you ever felt a smell that took you right back to when you were at your grandma's house? - yeah, that kind!). \n\n\nWhat I'm hear to ask is whether a drug-fuelled state can be imitated (at least to an extent) via NLP techniques. For example, setting a relaxation anchor when high on cannabis, or an anchor of confidence and certain while on cocaine. \n\n\nAssuming it is possible, would placebo play a role in any physiological changes that may occur?",

  "title":"Focus on what you want",
  "text":"Have you heard the expression 'Don't think about pink elephant!'? What do we find ourselves doing? - Thinking about pink elephants, of course. In order to make sense of the instruction, we first have to get a picture in our head of a pink elephant. So we have now done exactly what we have been told not to do, even though it wasn't our intention. That's how negative goals work, too. As we focus on what we don't want, inadvertently we are actually getting it.\n\n\nThinking about what you don't want is \nproblem thinking,\n whereas thinking about what you do want is \noutcome thinking.\n Problem thinking arises when we focus on the thing that's happening now, which is, of course, the thing we don't want. So the only way we will change and experience more of what we do want is to move away from the present problem state and towards the compelling outcome.\n\n\nThere are two directions in life, forward and backwards, towards and away from. NLP was developed and focused back in the 1960s on successful people that were all 'towards'-oriented. They didn't waste their time and energy on what they didn't want but focused on getting what they did want.\n\n\n'Away from' thinking focuses the mind on the present unsatisfactory situation that they want to change. When we try to get our brain to focus on what it doesn't want, it gets confused. Think about some of these goals; have you ever had goals like these?\n\n\n>'I want to give up smoking.'\n>'I must clean my room.'\n>'I've to stop eating junk food.'\n>'I hope I don't fail.'\n\n\nHave you ever told yourself 'I mustn't forget to...' and then found that you did indeed forget whatever it was. Your brain is saying, \n'Forget...'\n whereas, if instead, you told yourself \n'Remember to...',\n you'd have a lot more chance of being successful. It happens sometimes with children, doesn't it? People say, 'Be careful don't fall!' and then they do just that. It's because subconsciously they've heard the instruction to fall and they've focused on that word.\n\n\nWhen people are focusing on the problem and being in a problem state, there can be fear about what they'll do when the problem's fixed. What will they focus next? Will there be a void in their life? Some people worry that they are no longer worrying about this thing. This is another very good reason for focusing on something enjoyable, something they do want or who they want to be.\n\n\nTHE WORD 'TRY' IS THE ENEMY OF SUCCESSFUL GOAL-SETTING\n\n\nIt is simply a variation on problem-state thinking. The word 'trying' implies that you doubt whether you'll be successful but nevertheless, you're going to put it out there as a goal. By using the word 'try' no one is convinced you mean it, so you won't get any support. How hard are you trying really? It sounds as if this is a goal that you think you ought to have because someone else has suggested it, or you have read a book or blog post that recommends it, so you're going to give it a 'try'.\n\n\nInstead, remove the word 'try' and replace it with the belief that's important. It's something you do want to do, so start picturing how success would look. If, when you do this, it isn't that compelling, then change your goal to one that is.\n\n\nTrying does not form any part of goal-setting and doesn't belong there. Instead, word your goal in the positive as something that you will be or get and take responsibility for achieving it.\n\n\nI WANT...\n\n\nAs part of your personal development, start thinking about what you do want in every situation.\n\n\nEven, for example, when you're shopping and you're looking for a parking space, think in terms of 'I want a parking space' that than 'I bet I won't get a parking space.' Amazingly, it has been proved that people are more likely to get what they desire (yes even parking space) when they focus positive energy on what they want.\n\n\nIt's not just about what we say and how we think, it's the way we live our lives and what we notice. When we notice what's going well - the good decisions and choices we're making and the steps we're taking along the road to our goal - rather than pouncing on the disappointments and false moves, we will find ourselves closer to our goal.\n\n\nWhen, How, Where\n\n\nApart from wording your goal in the positive as something you do want, you can also orient yourself toward getting it by adding in words like 'when', for example. 'When I am fit, I will...' or 'When I have passed my exam, I will...' Add to this by building a picture of how you will look and where you will be. Can you get an image in your mind of yourself in the future?\n\n\nPeople who are able to picture themselves as a leader; manager and powerful influencer within their organization start working towards this role by dressing the part, networking and impressing those they need to impress. They not only want to see themselves in the role but they also want others to picture them there.\n\n\nWhen you talk about that time in the future when you will have achieved your goal, you make it start happening by talking as a different identity. Someone wanting to become healthier eats and behaves differently from someone who has a goal 'trying not to eat the wrong sort of food', and people wanting to move up the career ladder make sure that their work is done to deadline and that they behave in a way that shows them in the best possible light.\n\n\nWhen you talk about your goal like this and take on the new identity, it starts to become your reality. Your future is already becoming your present. There is no question in your mind that you will achieve your goal, as using the words 'If I get fit, I will...' would suggest. When we think in terms of 'If I achieve my goal...', it suggests that there is some doubt in your mind that it may not happen. It also firmly places you in today's problem state as opposed to being on the way to a future where your goal has been met.\n\n\nTLDR;\n Focusing on what we do want rather than on what we don't want is a matter of thinking first what we really want, imagine what it will be like and taking it on as our identity. This moves us from a state of problem thinking, where the focus is on what we don't want and moves us toward what we want.",

Do you have a FEAR or PHOBIA that you would like to be FREE from Now? This MIND SHIFT STRATEGYTM has worked for so many! We have seen instant and total elimination of\n\n\n\n\nFEAR OF HEIGHTS\n\n\nCLAUSTROPHOBIA\n\n\nAGORAPHOBIA\n\n\nHYPOCHONDRIA\n\n\nFEAR OF PUBLIC SPEAKING\n\n\nFEAR OF FAILURE\n\n\n& PTSD\n\n\n\n\nin my own practice and I am confident that that this simple but powerful technique will work for you NOW. Quickly, before we begin, if you have a fear of visualizing, imagination, cinemas, or movie theatres, please stop reading now and contact me directly for a different method.\nNow, before we get started, I need you to take a moment or two and imagine an activity which you are able to do very well. It could be anything, as long as you know for sure that you are excellent at it. Can you Bake a lasagna, are you an athlete, a host, a caretaker, a friend?\nTHINK now and really picture that activity which you know you are absolutely great at achieving. Now, the feeling you have when you picture yourself doing that action well, that feeling that you feel NOW is the mentality of a winner and the exact mental state that you must really be able to generate before we move on to the first step of this FAST + EASY MIND SHIFT STRATEGYTM. So, if you have been intentional and if you feel bold, continue.\n\n\nBODY\n\n\nNow, as you read these words, and now that you know that you have established a safe and clear mental state that makes you feel empowered and ready to engage with this successful solution to this little issue we can begin. First, imagine yourself entering your favorite movie theater. If you do not have a favorite, it doesn\u2019t really matter, but you must feel safe, secure, and the imagery of the theater must be vivid and real to you. As you smell the buttery popcorn wafting through the air, you may stop by the concession stand and grab a beverage or candy selection before entering the actual auditorium where we will pick our favorite seat. Did you make a selection? What did you get?\n\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/d5hpwrlx9es01.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=511deb877f01f7289ba1ff78a0644c0d59e966cf\n\n\nJolly ranchers, skittles, snickers, twizzlers, or traditional popcorn, get whatever you like.\n\n\nOk, great! As you find the perfect seat in the theater, you will now notice that there is a room at the back of the theater where the projector for the film is, that room is also for you; when ready, you will control when the movie will begin. The control room is entirely run by you, when you are ready to begin, however, it is important that you only visit the control room IF you need to see yourself watching the memory for any reason, but otherwise you will relax, get comfortable and control this video of your memory from your seat.\n\n\nAs you look around the empty and yet cozy theater, pick your favorite seat and settle down and relax. As you now begin to notice the lights in the theater dim, you will begin to see a movie play out on the screen in front of you. You\u2019ll have to squint a bit because the image is extremely small on the screen in front of you; as you adjust your eyes, you will begin to be amused as you see that the fuzzy, black and white picture is a movie of your memory. The small film is a picture featuring you as the HERO, but it is also of the FEAR or PHOBIA that we are about to eliminate. This is the event that occurred that started this series of emotions. Good. Now focus. The events on the screen will play at normal speed but there will be a few important differences; instead of the feelings we would normally feel, we are now going to layer a comical audio file over the top of the film. There will be no elaborate or scary sounds in this movie, other than humorous ones; be sure to use a laugh track from a sit com or your favorite funny theme song; I use THE OFFICE & It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia and play this over and over again to drown out the sounds of the original memory.\n\n\nNote: Occasionally, as some people have engaged with this image, they have felt overwhelmed by the thought of watching this memory play out; focus and relax, we have a solution for this as well! As you breathe steadily and peacefully, you can take a moment and drift back to the control room where you can watch yourself bravely facing the film of your fear. As you face your fear, now is a good time to encourage yourself and tell yourself how proud you are of yourself for facing this issue.\n \n\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ln0vf9m0aes01.jpg?width=710&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6603b7719514cfa32596e2516d6e40cd8123c4ba\n\n\nNow, as the film ends, it is time to take our power back from this memory. As we process how much better we already feel, the movie is over and the reel hums as it comes to an end. As this happens, we are going to stop the movie of our memories on the last frame.Now, look at your face on the screen and step into that body, you will now run that movie in reverse at 2XX the original speed as vividly and colorfully as you possibly can until you arrive back at the start. Fast, QUICKLY, RUN IT ALL THE WAY BACK!\nGOOD!\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nNow, as you look into the eyes of the new you, the you that has conquered that mental image that you had, how do you feel? Do you now feel freedom, joy, and peace? GREAT!! That means that you have completed this technique and you can live a life of confidence and victory over a minor issue that used to hold you back in some capacity. Congratulations on your Future and please share this content with someone that you want to enable to Be their own HERO just like you were able to do.\nIF YOU ENGAGE BETTER WITH A VISUAL EXAMPLE, I HAVE UPLOADED THIS TECHNIQUE TO YOUTUBE AND WILLPROVIDE THE LINK HERE: \n\n\nHOW TO CURE FEAR & PHOBIAS | NLP | REMOVE FEAR | CURE PHOBIA",

  "text":"HOW TO GAIN CONTROL IN 3 STEPS\n2018-03-21 | James Pesch | CPT NLP\nHOW TO GAIN CONTROL in 3 STEPS\n\n\nINTRO\nHow many times have you wished you could gain more control? What comes to mind first? As you think now about the time or times you have wanted control, which events rush into your mind fastest and could have turned out better for you? Now, that this imagery is clear, what do you mean by\n\n\n\u201cGAIN CONTROL?\u201d\n\n\nI immediately picture an aircraft pilot plummeting in a random spin toward earth. The pilot, with sweat pouring over his lips into his grit teeth, I know that his mission is to GAIN CONTROL of the craft; we ALL know the pilot is successfully able to GAIN CONTROL as he manages to handle the situation & save the maximum number of lives and prevent as many casualties as possible.\n\n\nSTEP 1\nAs I describe this scenario, you may have your own idea of what it means to GAIN CONTROL of a situation pop into your mind, this is PERFECT! Use your scenario NOW; the main starting point for this technique to work is\n\n\nFind, create, or invent VIVID and emotionally stimulating IMAGERY and mental avatars like the scenario I just described that give you strong associations with what it means to GAIN CONTROL. For me, this is often reflected in those we see as HEROES\n\n\nFIREFIGHTERS & PUBLIC SERVANTS \nTEACHERS & COUNSELORS\nDOCTORS & NURSES\nRESEARCHERS & SCIENTISTS\nWARRIORS & MARTYRS\n\n\nSTEP 2\nUse the imagery to create a mental scenario. Think and focus now while you begin to use these examples to draw a bridge of correlation; some call this METHOD a parable or analogy wherein you find a way to make your actual situation you are living out (relationship, career, habits, anxiety, etc.) and then you simulate the imaginary scenario to demonstrate to yourself what it would look like for you to be your own HERO, and see yourself GAIN CONTROL over the situation similar to the Pilot\/Plane scenario WHILE drawing an emotional correlation to your specific circumstance.\n\n\n\n\nConnect and correlate the specific outcomes that would demonstrate why you as the pilot of your situation would benefit from being able to GAIN CONTROL, and what the results WILL BE once you do. As the plane hurls toward the earth and everyone on board panics, SEE yourself remain calm and collected, you, as THE pilot, are the ONLY one who is capable of successfully being able to GAIN CONTROL now and you know that you are qualified, strong, and confident that you do have the right answers even if you can not control the outcome fully.\n\n\n\n\nAs you now begin to see yourself able to right the craft, and with all your strength and courage, you are able to do whatever it takes and grab the control stick and land yourself and everyone else safely, don\u2019t you NOW begin to see how your life will improve and how much easier it will be to GAIN CONTROL of any of your situations once you realize that ONLY you can?\n\n\nSTEP 3\nFinally, How will your life improve once this issue is resolved?!\nWhew!\nThe plane has been landed, by you! CONGRATULATIONS!! You were able to GAIN CONTROL of your situation, and fully create the imagery you need to overcome those fears that use to limit your ability to GAIN CONTROL. Now, that you have done this for your situation (relationship, career, habits, anxiety, etc.,) How has your life improved?\n\n\n\n\nFocus on the end goal and successful scenario where you were able to be your own HERO and GAIN CONTROL of your situation. Create clear and vivid pictures of the lives which will be changed and the improvements you will feel as you begin to use this FAST & EASY MIND HACK to GAIN CONTROL of this situation. What does it look like now that you have been able to GAIN CONTROL in this area?\n\n\n\n\nBE SPECIFIC as you begin to write down exactly how your life will improve.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThat\u2019s it!!\nAs you begin to use this FAST & EASY MIND HACK to GAIN CONTROL of THIS situation, you may find a strong desire to use it for other areas in your life that held you back so here is a summary of the 3 steps!\nFind, create, or invent VIVID and emotionally stimulating IMAGERY and mental avatars like the scenario I just described that give you strong associations with what it means to GAIN CONTROL. For me, this is often reflected in those we see as HEROES.\nConnect and correlate the specific outcomes that would demonstrate why you as the pilot of your situation would benefit from being able to GAIN CONTROL, How do you know you do need to GAIN CONTROL? BE SPECIFIC.\nFocus on the END goal and successfully completed scenario where you were able to be your own HERO and GAIN CONTROL of your situation. Imagine what you will look like, how you will feel about this, and how others will be affected by this positive change.\nGreat! If you engaged intentionally then you are finished! If not, do it 3 times from start to finish each time connecting more with being the HERO of the scenarios. I highly encourage you to look for more ways to incorporate this POWERFUL technology in other areas of your thought life; also, I do this full time and am available if you have trouble with mental imagery or need scientific data or resources to learn more about how these and all my MIND HACKS work so fast and effectively!\n\n\nWATCH THE VIDEO INSTEAD!!",

  "text":"Guys, I am 35 now and suffered from premature ejaculation almost my whole life.

  "title":"Sources of NLP for absolute beginners?",
  "text":"So I've been super interested in NLP since I first come across it some time ago. But I haven't done anything with it because the NLP space is so chaotic and messy and not very friendly to non-gurus and people who need the benefit of the techniques, but aren't well-versed about the topic and aren't excellent researchers.\n\n\nThere's various sources I found and various websites, but when I visit the website, I'm often greeted with a site that does not look legit, or a website that is down, or a website that seems not to reflect the power of NLP in the website's construction itself. I mean, you'd think someone with the power of NLP can manage to build a decent, welcoming modern-looking website.\n\n\nOverall, the journey to learn NLP is not in any way friendly or encouraging. Sometimes I get the impression that this is a power from the gods. But I never find it easy to acquire the power. It's like I have to sift through a whole bunch of garbage, filter it all out myself, and \nmaybe\n come out the other side with something useful to use in my life.\n\n\nAnother way of looking at the issue I'm introducing here: It's impossible for me to recommend anyone to start learning NLP. Where would I point them to? Which book would I recommend for them? Which techniques would I give them as an introduction to what NLP can do for them? Where would they then go to learn more about this? I can't expect everybody to research rigorously in order to learn something new.\n\n\nAn example of such an issue outside the realm of NLP that has been properly solved: If someone has never used a computer and you want to introduce them to this new power that is computers and the internet, you can simply tell them to buy the newest MacBook, and that's it. Period. Problem solved. Where would they go to learn more about this awesome new technology thing? They can take a look at other products Apple provides.\n\n\nNow this is an extremely well-solved example, I don't imagine this NLP thing to turn out the same way so soon of course. But just to give you some perspective.\n\n\nI bought a \"Best-Seller\" NLP book (\"NLP 2.0\") and was disappointed by it. I know I can make more out of it, but it isn't making it very easy on me. Which is part of the problem I'm hoping using NLP techniques would help me deal with. Just to bring up one last point: Rarely can I find NLP techniques that I can \nactually apply\n and that a\nre actually relev\nant to me. I'm very disappointed to find out how hard it is to find generic NLP techniques that deal with extremely common issues that almost everyone in the modern world has. Such as anxiety and whatnot.",

If they state that they are looking for an affordable solution, then you find and deliver the most \u201cAFFORDABLE,\u201d solution you have, etc.\n\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0STEP 3: USE Vague & Ambiguous Language\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0STEP 3: Use words like \u201cRarely, Sometimes, Occassionally, Often, etc.\u201d\n\n\nMost people are totally ok with words like Most, Often, Rarely, Usually, because although they appear to be leaning toward one end of a behavioral spectrum, there is still plenty of room in these words for cognitive relativism. Most of us can find ourselves agreeing with someone who is opinionated but leaves much space in the conversation to be themselves entirely incorrect about their opinion, that is why these words have a tendency to be useful in building emotional rapport.\n\n\nThere are certain words which do NOT allow for this cognitive space and distances others from our perspective or words:\n\n\n>\nNEVER USE \u201cNEVER;\u201d ALWAYS STAY AWAY FROM USING \u201cALWAYS\u201d\n\n\n(unless the audience volunteers \u201cNever or Always,\u201d just don\u2019t.\n\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Step 4 Create an Out: Offer a double bind option\n\n\nSTEP 4: Offer The Linguistic Double Bind\n\n\nMany expert and human behavior specialists develop subtle and savvy strategies to get the result they want in conversation by offering an out in the way of a double bind.\n\n\nFor Parents: \"You\u2019ve been very well behaved today, would you like to go to bed at 8:00 or 8:30pm?\u201d\n\n\nFor Sales: \u201cAs someone who is obviously, honest and transparent, like myself, would you rather disclose the budget you are working with, or would you just like to move forward to the pricing options we are currently offering?\u201d\n\n\nFor Cold-Reading & Barnum Statements: \u201cI can tell you are someone who is smart and that causes you have a tendency to hide details from others, however, once you establish trust, you\u2019ll find that you are quite open to sharing your deepest thoughts.\u201d\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nAs you now begin to use these 4 FAST + EASY Steps to increase your own influence, pay it forward and tell others about your ability to optimize your success and future relationships & share this article with as many people as you can.\n\n\n\u00a0Visualize the impact you will have on your social circle and the ways you will be able to help those around you by making them feel incredible about themselves and take special note of the ways this will change the level of influence you begin to experience in your day to day life.\n\n\n\u00a0Thank you so much for reading, and if the above article was not quite good enough, please checkout my 5:00 min YouTube Video where I share the 4 steps quickly!\n\n\nGAIN TRUST IN 4 STEPS\n\n\nEnjoy and don't forget to Be Your Own HERO!!\n\n\nJames Pesch welcomes you back!

However, somehow he translated this into desire for inner peace (I had to remember a happy peaceful moment from the past and that feeling would come up in stressful moments). I think I communicated well, I voiced my concern that I was not looking for \"peace\", so I'm not sure if this mismatch of expectations is a feature (he somehow \"reads\" that what I actually need is peace) or a bug (he can't and don't want to act on issues of self-esteem and optimism).\n\n\nThe thing is our family is closing our business and I must do something else from now on.

  "title":"Creating and Utilizing characters to act as, to conquer motivation issues.",
  "text":"Hi all! So I'm extremely new to NLP, but stumbled upon it \nafter\n I designed a method to fight procrastination and motivation issues with myself. I've only known about NLP for a couple months now, and haven't done much reading into beyond super light stuff.\nIt only just struck me a couple days ago that what I've been doing might actually be linked with NLP. To be honest I don't know enough about it to say for certain if it is or isn't. I'd love to know if this can in fact be considered NLP, but if not, please let me know! \n\n\nSo basically, I've created three characters that each serve a specific purpose in my life. They each represent qualities either of myself, or that I wish to have myself, in perfect quantities. Their ultimate purpose is to continually develop them and utilize them to, in an acting\/power-of-imagination sense, impose my body. So when I need the one that is extremely hardworking to push through work motivations I'm having, I'll force her personality to impose my own. I am no longer myself, I am instead her. My self is off floating around in the brain somewhere, enjoying the relaxation of doing nothing.\nThese characters are continually being developed in detailed ways so that they are believable, relatable 'people' which causes them to become easier to 'use' as time progresses.\nIt's worked extremely well so far, and results are improving over time and with character development. Mileage may vary depending on how much effort you put into the start of each 'imposition'.\n\n\nInspiration for this method: Interview with Sir Patrick Stewart's in which his stage acting methods was talked about.\n\n\nIt's a method I've been developing for a while now, but have never heard of anything quite like it before. I'm really curious if this sort of thing already exists. Since this is something I just came up with, it would be nice if there was already something already developed so I have additional help designing it. There's SO much more detail about all of this, but I'm being intentionally brief since, again, I'm not entirely sure this counts as NLP in the first place. I'm still fresh little newbie with only a vague understanding of it. If anyone wants more details about any part of it, I'm happy to answer.\n\n\nAnyways, thanks for reading!",

Severe depression\/bipolar, masochism, drug addiction, etc. I don't want to write a whiney post, just trying to give some background info.\nI discovered Richard Bandler when I was around 17 years old and the things I learned completely changed the way that I think about life in general. I have listened, watched and read a lot of his material, as well as s few other NLP \"trainers\". The only problem is, is that it seems to be short lived for me. It comes in phases and then just fades away, leaving myself in the same place I was before. I feel that a lot of this is due to the issue of not knowing where to get new material or networking with people who don't think I'm f*cking insane when I talk about it. I am NOT into NLP to try and hypnotize some smoking babe into being my girlfriend like some people Lol.

I really want to achieve this, because once in a while (especially when I'm tired or bored), bad\/embarrassing memories would appear in my head and made me feel sad. I feel like I'm really supposed to resolve them and stop dwelling on them in the future.\n\n\nHowever, due to conflicting schedule, I wasn't able to attend the last two days. Also, at the end of the first day, the trainer gave us a homework exercise where we had to think of 10 good and bad memories that occurred in three equal phases from our birth to the present. However, because of my absence, I don't know what to do with these memories that I listed.\n\n\nDoes anyone have a hint on how I should proceed with these memories? A book recommendation of similar techniques would help as well!\n\n\nThank you all for reading.",

  "title":"Can NLP change your mental associations? If so, how?",
  "text":"Hey everyone! I'm new to learning NLP and I think it's fascinating.\n\n\nMy question is that I\u2019d like to change my emotional associations with things. For example:\n\n\nNegative \u2192 Positive:\n I don\u2019t like driving \u2192 I love driving\n\n\nPositive \u2192 Negative:\n I love unhealthy food \u2192 I don\u2019t like unhealthy food as much\n\n\nRemove an emotional association altogether:\n I feel good\/bad about something \u2192 \u201cEh\u201d\n\n\nI\u2019m already trying affirmations and I also want to add this emotional kick as well. Telling myself \u201cI enjoy driving\u201d is not enough for me; I also want to instill deep subconscious associations (like feelings\/memories\/etc.) into myself so I\u2019ll feel a pleasurable emotional spike whenever I drive.\n\n\nSo, a few questions:\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the strategy to do the above?\n\n\n\n\nTo change a negative to a positive or vice versa, do you first need to make it neutral (negative \u2192 neutral) then add the new association (neutral \u2192 positive)? Or does the new one automatically overwrite the old one?\n\n\n\n\nI know that, generally, it is better to frame things positively. (\"I will succeed\" is better than \"I'll try not to fail\".) But isn\u2019t it good to have negative associations with things in some cases? It seems to me like associating healthy food with \"good\" while also associating unhealthy food with \"bad\" is twice as powerful as doing just one. (I\u2019m not going to go extreme and convince myself that bad food is evil or anything like that. I just want a little negative association so I\u2019ll think twice about touching it.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks! :)",

  "title":"Is anyone familiar with Allen Carr\u2019s? Also, how does it work from a NLP standpoint?",
  "text":"From an NLP\/Hypnosis perspective what does he do? How does his method work. I\u2019m trying to reverse engineer the process so people can use it for other bad habits.\n\n\nI want to break it down to a framework.\n\n\nSo far I broke this theory down to the following explanation: As we know, humans are pleasure seeking animals. Pleasure, (for our ancestors at least) was natures way of rewarding you when you performed actions beneficial to our survival. It also used pain to keep us from undesirable elements of nature. Modern living has messed this system up a bit (desire for calories, addictions, etc.) But aside from pure rewards and  there\u2019s also a subjective nature to pleasure and pain\n\n\nYou can seemingly focus on the pros and cons of any given behavior and alter that behavior.\n\n\nFor example B.F. Skinner\u2019s experiments with rats showed that a rat would perform an action that produced pleasure (reward) and would avoid an action that produced pain (punishment.)\n\n\nBut Dr. Aaron T. Beck, the founder of Cognitive Behavior Therapy added a caveat. These rewards\/punishments have a subjective nature to them. Pure behaviorists see things differently, but let\u2019s save that for another time. For now let\u2019s take it at face value So Rewards and Punishments are at least partially subjective. In very laymen terms people do things they think are good, and avoid things they think are bad.\n\n\nWhile that sounds obvious, that may be the most profound notion when it comes to modifying behavior.\n\n\nWhat it seems that Allen Carr does is take every argument that smokers generally have gategorizing smoking as \u201cgood\u201d and shows them why they\u2019re full of nonsense.\n\n\nExamples from the illustrated version:\n\n\nhttp:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/sUQo8\n\n\nHe basically says \u201coh you think this is a reward? Let me tell you why this is actually a punishment.\u201d Or at least a neutral stimuli.\n\n\nHe systematically takes every \u201cbenefit\u201d to smoking and crushes it.\n\n\nThis really hits home when there\u2019s a chapter on the benefits of smoking. It\u2019s just 4 or 5 blank pages until he continues the rest of the book.\n\n\nBut he takes a unique approach to smoking cessation and behavior modification. Think of every smoker having a mental Pros and Cons list. While the commercials try to add reasons you shouldn\u2019t smoke (thereby adding things to the \u201cCons\u201d list) Allen Carr seemingly removes the things that that smoker has on their \u201cPros\u201d list. Which works like a charm. They say \u201cWhy do you smoke\u201d then removes those mental reasons. It\u2019s essentially the carrot and the stick argument. The commercials, national health organizations try to add mental sticks by showing you images of people with their voice boxes removes, amputees, etc. But Allen Carr just says \u201cThere\u2019s no carrot there in the first place, so why even do it?\u201d\n\n\nThe technique I came up with so far is:\nA) List all the PROS, or positive aspects to this behavior. Be honest. What does this behavior do for you?\nB) Now pretend you\u2019re the world\u2019s greatest defense attorney and explain why this argument is completely ridiculous, and provide a counter argument.\n\n\nMake yourself realize it\u2019s just a trick you\u2019re pulling on yourself.\n\n\ni.e.: \u201cI don\u2019t get enough work done when I know I should\n\n\nReasons: \u201cI like to relax\u201d\nArgument: \u201cIs this really helping you to relax? You constantly stress about deadlines. You would be significantly more relaxed if you just got it done THEN relaxed.\u201d\n\n\nAnyway, can anyone provide a little insight, or help me develop my technique? I heard NLP has a similar technique called propulsion. Maybe understanding that will help me. But any insight will help.",

  "title":"NLP Weekly Topic #1",
  "text":"Hello everybody! I recently wrote the post on systematically assimilating NLP. The idea is to practice certain aspects of NLP until they become a part of automatic behavior. As suggested, I am going to make weekly topics to focus on for at least a week, until that behavior becomes automatic. Before utilizing NLP, building rapport with somebody is necessary. Therefore, I decided to make the weekly topic #1 Mirroring, focusing on building rapport with people. This is probably best suited for somebody who is at least somewhat familiar with the mindsets, and has some basic knowledge about NLP. I googled just now and came across this useful website. \nhttp:\/\/nlp-mentor.com\/presuppositions\/\n That is not my website i just googled it. \n\n\nMirroring\n\n\nThere are a lot of different aspects to mirroring and matching another person. It is a very broad category to focus on, and will likely take more than one week to fully master. Mirroring and matching is a way to build rapport with people by respecting their model of the world so much that you assume it. This can be done by standing in the same posture as somebody, using the same words they do. (My friends to describe something they like, use the word \"rugged\".) Using the same tone of voice, speed of speech, quality of voice, eye blink rate, facial expression, behaviors, and breathing rate. I'm certain this could be broken down further, but for now I believe it is at least a good starting point. \n\n\nWhen I was focusing on mirroring a while back, I would try to tackle ever aspect of it at once. I found that it was too much, and i had to start with only focusing on peoples posture. After starting to notice that unconsciously I would move on to a different part. Breathing rate is very difficult, but there are some good strategies to do that. \n\n\n-I have a quick story about breathing rate:  I was in the basement of my house with a few friends. One of these friends was telling an in depth story to a few other friends for a few minutes now. I started to mirror his breathing rate.  All of a sudden, he stopped dead in his tracks telling the story, looked up at my face and said \"WOAH\". I looked up at him, and said \"Did you feel it?\". He responded with \"Yeah... I did.\"  The mirroring and synchonization of our breathing rates had an effect on the connection we had at that moment. This is one (albiet a strong) step of many in the game of building rapport with an individual; with an eventual goal of a positive and almost symbiotic relationship.\n\n\nThe focus of this topic is to incorporate mirroring into our automatic behavior to help build better relationships with people. Now I wouldnt suggest copying people exactly, as it will likely be found offensive. Mirroring should be out of concious awareness. Also instead of using the exact behavior, gesture, or posture for example, crossing arms could be matched by crossing your legs. It won't have as strong an effect as mirroring, but as you dont want to be obvious it is just another choice available for you to use.\n\n\nNow, I suggest anybody who wants to participate, that you specifically look for certain things people do, and how you can mirror or match them, and doing it. I encourage anybody to do this, I will be doing it for the next week at least as the last time I've done this was about 6 months ago.\n\n\nI would also love to hear from anybodies experience too.",

  "title":"Systematically assimilating NLP",
  "text":"What I want to talk about are practical ways to incorporate certain aspects of NLP into behaviors unconsciously. I read and study NLP often, and think about it throughout my everyday life. I often come across suggestions stating \"don't learn NLP like this\" or \"reading about NLP won't help you learn it, go practice it\". These statements are very true and often leave out a deal of information. I believe \"NLP\" is often used as a nominalization. I am referring to a process that has been turned into a noun. NLP by nature encompasses a lot of different material, from mirroring, to anchoring, to the the meta model, to reframing just for a few examples. It makes sense to me that it should be practiced first hand. How, though? And what. During my journeys of reading NLP books it was suggested to focus on one thing at a time until it became an unconscious habit. This makes a lot of sense to me because I can relate it to the way I have learned other skills in life. When I played chess, I would study opening moves a lot, and it got to a point where I could make my first 5 moves without thinking about them at all, because I knew the preferable response to every major opening that would be used competitively. I sat down with a friend last Monday and we were talking about \"NLP\" (whatever that means ;) and despite me having a lot of knowledge on the topic as a whole, it was difficult for me to incorporate all the techniques easily. So I thought about focusing on one thing for a week to start with. Personally, I started with mirroring a while ago. My only goal was to observe people's postures, specifically when they were engaged with another person. Eventually I would automatically notice when people were in the same posture. Then I moved onto voice tonality. At least for me it seemed as an effective way to incorporate NLP into my life practically. I need to move on to another aspect, and I welcome and invite any and all suggestions or feedback.\n\n\nTLDR  focus on one aspect of NLP at a time until it becomes automatic.",

Same thing at \"Dating-Sites\".\n\n\nWant reasons? I love to party, but I love to play Computergames too. In addition to that I love to \"obsess\" over (didn't find any better translation) the things I do. So when I'm in \"Computer-play-mode\" I'm there for weeks or months. When I'm in \"Party-Mode\" it's the same, maybe it doesn't last as long, but you get the gist I hope. My former best friend kept criticizing me during \"Computer-play-mode\", I wouldn't go out enough with him. That went pretty far. As far as me telling him to gtfo of my life. So yeah, pretty bad.\n\n\nNow I'm asking your, brothers and sisters in the NLP Community:\nSuggestions for a format? I'll be trying out an FPC right after writing this.",
